      <p>When a creature moves within 5 feet of the brown mold for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) cold damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.</p>
      <p>Brown mold is not only immune to fire damage but rapidly grows when exposed to flames. When any source of fire — the effects of a spell like fire bolt, a lit torch, and so on—happens within 5 feet of a patch of brown mold, the brown mold rapidly expands to surround it in a 10-foot radius. However, any amount of cold damage instantly destroys a patch of brown mold.</p>`,

When a creature attacks from within a crowd or attacks a target within a crowd, on a miss by 10 or more the attack hits a crowd member and the creature makes a Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion check (DC 13 + 2 per previous check) to convince the crowd not to attack it.

A creature that covers its mouth and nose with a damp cloth has advantage on this save.
