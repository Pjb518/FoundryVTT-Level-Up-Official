        <h3>Community Discord Server</h3>

        <p>
            The best way to get support is to <a
                href="https://discord.gg/XtkZ6RkN9E"
                target="_blank">join our Discord server</a
            >. We have a very friendly community with lots of experienced users who can
            provide live support should you need any help. We also have dedicated channels
            for filing issue reports or submitting feature requests.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our Discord server is also home to most of the Level Up third-party
            publishers, and we make regular posts showcasing new official and third-party
            releases in the announcements channel.
        </p>

        <h3>GitHub</h3>

        <p>
            If you're not into Discord, you can also submit issue reports and feature
            requests on <a
                href="https://github.com/Pjb518/FoundryVTT-Level-Up-Official"
                target="_blank">the system's GitHub repository</a
            >. We check these tickets very frequently, but you're not typically going to
            get a response as quickly as you would on Discord.
