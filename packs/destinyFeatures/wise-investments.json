    "description": "<p>The fabulously wealthy stay wealthy by creating businesses or investing wisely&mdash;then the engine of industry works tirelessly to keep the vaults full. You have a rich lifestyle (see lifestyle expenses).</p>\n<p>In addition, living lavishly can be reinvigorating. You can lavish yourself and any number of other creatures with luxuries whenever you start a long rest at the cost of 100 gold per creature. Each creature lavished in this way is cured of all diseases and poison, becomes immune to poison and being frightened, and makes all Wisdom saving throws with advantage. A creature&rsquo;s hit point maximum also increases by 2d10, and it gains the same number of hit points. These benefits last for 24 hours.</p>",
