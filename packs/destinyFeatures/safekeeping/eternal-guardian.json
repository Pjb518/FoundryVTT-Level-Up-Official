Your effective physical age becomes early middle age (the equivalent of 35 for a human) or if you are already older when you achieve this feature you slowly de-age to that level of physical ability. You may still retain some gray hair or wrinkles (player&rsquo;s discretion) to mark your wisdom and experience. You no longer age (and cannot die of old age or have your effective age altered by magic), are resistant to poison and necrotic damage, have advantage on saves against poison, and are immune to disease. In addition, if you were already resistant to poison or necrotic damage, you become immune to that type of damage instead.</p>",
