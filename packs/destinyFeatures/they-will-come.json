Work with the narrator to establish the location and particulars of this stronghold. Your passion has also inspired others. You gain one additional free&nbsp;follower&nbsp;(see Stronghold Types in Chapter 4: Equipment of Adventurer&rsquo;s Guide) for every 5 class levels you have. These followers are dedicated to your cause, and if they leave your service or die, you can replace them for no cost upon returning to your stronghold. You cannot act with impunity, however, and treating these followers poorly will have an impact on your cause and reputation.</p>",
