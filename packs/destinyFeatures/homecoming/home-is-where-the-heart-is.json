		"description": "<p>Having finally returned home, you can never truly be separated from it again, even if your adventures continue. You are always considered to be in a haven when taking a long rest, and any feature or effect that would reduce your fatigue or strife reduces it by twice as much. In addition, once per week, you and your party may gain the benefits of a long rest by taking a short rest. Although a creature cannot benefit from this improved rest more than once per week, this feature does not count against how often a creature may benefit from the improved rest granted by a Grade 2 house stronghold, nor vice versa.</p>",
