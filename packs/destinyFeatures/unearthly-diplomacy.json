		"description": "<p>Your unearthly aspirations grant you insights into the minds of even utterly alien beings.</p><p>As an action, you may spend your inspiration to form a connection with a non-humanoid creature you can see that has a CR equal to or less than your level. You communicate freely, even if you do not share a language or the creature would be normally unable to speak. You have no control over a creature you connect with in this way but you gain an expertise die on checks made to influence it. The knowledge and awareness of a creature is limited by its intellect or perceptions, but most give you information about nearby locations, monsters in the area, and knowledge of whatever it perceived within the past day. This connection lasts for up to 1 hour or until you use an action to end it.</p>",
