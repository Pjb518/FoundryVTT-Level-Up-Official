		"description": "<p>Like your vampiric parent you may briefly assume a lesser form of mist. As an action, you may turn yourself and everything that you are carrying into a hovering wispy cloud, as in the spell @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.y4vmyqfeede94imc]{Gaseous Form}, though it is always considered to be cast at 5th level for you in terms of calculating your flying speed. This form lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier, until it is dispelled, or until you choose to end it as a bonus action.</p>\n<p>If you are still airborne when this effect ends or you drop to 0 hit points, you fall at a rate of 30 feet per round. Once you have assumed this form of mist in this way, you cannot do so again until you complete a long rest.</p>",
