Whether through natural or forced evolution, space-time anomalies, or other strange quirks of galactic exploration, some humans have evolved beyond the limitations of the physical. Many people with this gift are marked by some telltale sign of their mental power or their evolution, such as glowing eyes or loss of vestigial or unused traits.</p>\n<p>Your natural abilities allow you limited ability to command a potent effect. Choose a level I psionic power. You know your chosen power and you can manifest it once without expending psionic points. You must finish a long or a short rest before you can manifest it in this way again. Your manifesting ability modifier for this trait is the same as the ability score used in the manifesting class in which you have the highest level, or Intelligence if you have no levels in a manifesting class.</p>",
