		"description": "<p>When humans began to venture into deep space, many never settled down. Whether living their lives as asteroid miners within their solar system, living aboard space stations, or as members of generational colony ships, some humans found themselves particularly suited to life within zero gravity. For some, this is evolution in action, for others it is wanderlust turned outward toward the stars. You have the following traits:</p>\n<p><strong>Space Legs.</strong> You are adapted to the unique rigors of zero gravity, suffering minimal disorientation and even showing increased mobility. While in zero gravity, your base speed increases by 10 feet and you gain a climb speed equal to your base speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Vacuum Resistance.</strong> The harsh vacuum of space is an ever-present threat in space travel, but you are adapted to it, for a time. You gain an expertise die to Constitution checks to resist the effects of a hard vacuum, and add your proficiency bonus to the number of minutes you can hold your breath. In addition, you gain resistance to cold damage.</p>",
