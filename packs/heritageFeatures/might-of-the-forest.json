You gain the following benefits:+</p>\n<p><strong>Fists of the Forest. </strong>As part of an attack when you are unarmed, you can turn one or both of your hands into a club, greatclub, or quarterstaff. You can turn them back instantly at any time.</p>\n<p><strong>Entangling Grasp. </strong>You know the shillelagh cantrip. You can stick your fist into the soil as an action, causing you to cast entangle without spending a spell slot and reducing your speed to 0 until the spell ends. You can do so once between long rests. Your spellcasting ability for these spells is your choice of Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.</p>",
