You gain the following benefits:</p><p><strong><em>Death Offers No Rest</em></strong>. A year and one day after obtaining this gift, or once you complete your Destiny, you are doomed. Until then you gain the following benefits:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>If you are below half your hit point maximum at the start of your turn, you regain 1 hit point. However, when you spend hit dice during a short rest, you only recover half as many hit points as normal.</p></li><li><p>If you die, you return to \"life\" 24 hours after death. If your body is destroyed, you reform within 1 mile of the place of your death at a spot determined by the Narrator, possibly by requisitioning an unused corpse. If your equipment was also destroyed, you do not regain it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ul>",
