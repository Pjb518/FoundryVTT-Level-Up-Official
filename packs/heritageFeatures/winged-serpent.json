These sinuous are more likely than most to have colorful scales and feathers on other parts of their bodies such as a feathered crest on their heads or shoulders. You have the following trait:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Flight.</strong></em> You have a fly speed of 30 feet. To use this speed, you can&rsquo;t be wearing medium or heavy armor. Whenever you spend 3 full consecutive rounds airborne without landing, you gain a level of fatigue. Any fatigue gained in this way is removed upon finishing a short or long rest.</p>",
