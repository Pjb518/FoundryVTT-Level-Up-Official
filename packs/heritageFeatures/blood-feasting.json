As part of a short rest, you can sink your teeth into the corpse of a Humanoid which has died within the past hour and drain it of blood. At the end of that rest, you regain a number of hit dice equal to your proficiency modifier (never exceeding your hit dice maximum). A corpse can be used for this trait no more than once. Once you have used this trait to regain a number of hit dice equal to your character level, you can’t gain any more until you complete a long rest.</p>",
