		"description": "<p>You were born with a magical seal skin that grows with you and which may be worn alongside other clothes and armor. As a bonus action while wearing the skin, you may shapeshift into either a seal or sea lion, chosen at character creation. You cannot later change your choice. In either case, your alternate form is referred to as your &ldquo;seal form.&rdquo; Your skin is specific to you and cannot be used by any other creature, even another selkie.</p>\n<p>While in seal form, you retain your hit points, as well as the Sea-Longings and Insulated features from the selkie base heritage. Likewise, you may still choose to use features that grant you an alternate AC (such as the berserker&rsquo;s @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.j2n9an7ozhbs1hlp]{Rugged Defense} feature) if they do not require armor. Any equipment you are wearing or wielding merges into your new form and has no effect until you leave the form.</p>\n<p>You may remain in your seal form indefinitely, including while unconscious. However, your transformation ends if you are reduced to 0 hit points or choose to end it as a bonus action. If you gain the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.3jdfihvtbyhbv9ez]{Wild Shape} feature, this feature does not gain any of its benefits. If you lose your skin, you can create new skin for yourself using the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.acw9pizt7nhzdwdl]{Regenerate} spell or by using magic of similar or greater power, subject to Narrator discretion.</p>",
