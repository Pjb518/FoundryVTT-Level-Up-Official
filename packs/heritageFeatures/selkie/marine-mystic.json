Marine mystics hear more than the murmurings of the currents below the waters; they know from whence the waves came and where they will fall. You gain the following trait:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Hear the Ocean.</strong></em> You have inherent knowledge of the Aquan language. In addition, aquatic beasts and monstrosities understand anything you verbally communicate to them in Aquan, and you can understand them in return.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Time and Tide.</strong></em> You have a limited ability to see into the future. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.p3kung5mqpo30nbi]{Premonition} sign of faith from the cleric class.</p>",
