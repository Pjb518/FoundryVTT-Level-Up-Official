You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<p><strong>Death Offers No Rest.&nbsp;</strong>A year and one day after obtaining this gift, or once you complete your Destiny, you are doomed. Until then you gain the following benefits:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you are below half your hit point maximum at the start of your turn, you regain 1 hit point. However, when you spend hit dice during a short rest, you only recover half as many hit points as normal.</p>\n<p>If you die, you return to \"life\" 24 hours after death. If your body is destroyed, you reform within 1 mile of the place of your death at a spot determined by the Narrator, possibly by requisitioning an unused corpse. If your equipment was also destroyed, you do not regain it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Relentless Pursuit.</strong> Work with your Narrator to select one creature involved in your Destiny (your object of revenge, subject of devotion, etc.). You can spend 1 minute focusing on that creature. If the creature is dead or on another plane of existence, you learn that. Otherwise, after focusing, you know the distance and direction to that creature.</p>",
