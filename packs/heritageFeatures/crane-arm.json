Choose one of the following.</p><p><em>Arc Welder Extension: </em>This extension functions as the shocking grasp cantrip (using your highest ability score as its spellcasting&nbsp;ability) but its effects are&nbsp;nonmagical.</p><p><em>Flamethrower Extension: </em>This extension functions as the produce flame cantrip (using your highest ability score as its spellcasting&nbsp;ability) but its effects are&nbsp;nonmagical.</p><p><em>Multi-Tool Extension: </em>You are proficient with and can deploy built-in navigator&rsquo;s tools, thieves&rsquo; tools, and tinker&rsquo;s tools with this&nbsp;extension.</p>",
