For holding, grasping, and using objects, you can use a bonus action to swap your extension out for an articulated hand. While not wielding a shield, you can use your arm to wield a weapon with properties that would normally require two hands (loading,&nbsp;two-handed) or if wielding a versatile&nbsp;weapon to be treated as wielding it two&nbsp;handed. Choose one of the following.</p>\n<p><em>Arc Welder Extension: </em>This extension functions as the shocking grasp cantrip (using your highest ability score as its spellcasting&nbsp;ability) but its effects are&nbsp;nonmagical.</p>\n<p><em>Flamethrower Extension: </em>This extension functions as the produce flame cantrip (using your highest ability score as its spellcasting&nbsp;ability) but its effects are&nbsp;nonmagical.</p>\n<p><em>Multi-Tool Extension: </em>You are proficient with and can deploy built-in navigator&rsquo;s tools, thieves&rsquo; tools, and tinker&rsquo;s tools with this&nbsp;extension.</p>",
