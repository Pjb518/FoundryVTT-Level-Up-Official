Medical treatments utilizing nanobots work on you as normal, however, and specialized treatments exist. Most rolls that would call for a Medicine check for an organic creature are substituted for an Engineering check, depending on the condition and availability of parts.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can still expend Hit Dice and regain hit points as normal on a short or long rest due to your self-repair functions.</p>",
