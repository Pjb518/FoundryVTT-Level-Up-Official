		"description": "<p>As humans began to venture away from their world and explore the galaxy, they encountered hardships and challenges they never could have imagined—and proved themselves to be one of the most adaptable species in the cosmos. Confronting each new hurdle head-on, humans began to tinker with their genetics, creating new adaptations capable of surviving anything the galaxy could throw at it. Through splicing non-human or synthetic DNA, ancestors of these humans take human survival skills to a new frontier. Beyond basic survivability, you are adapted for one specific environment. You gain the following trait:</p>\n<p><strong>Just Like Home.&nbsp;</strong>Choose one type of terrain, reflecting the area from which your family hails: arctic, desert, mountain, or swamp. You ignore all naturally created difficult terrain of that type. Additionally, you gain an expertise die on Survival checks made within this terrain type, and gain a type of damage resistance related to your chosen terrain: arctic—cold, desert—fire, mountain—lightning, swamp—poison.</p>",
