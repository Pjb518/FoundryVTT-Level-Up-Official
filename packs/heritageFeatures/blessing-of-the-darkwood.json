You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can&rsquo;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\n<p><strong>Fey Ancestry.</strong> You gain an expertise die on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can&rsquo;t put you to sleep.</p>\n<p><strong>Druidic Elder.</strong> As one of the oldest trees in the wood, you are well acquainted with the druidic ways.
