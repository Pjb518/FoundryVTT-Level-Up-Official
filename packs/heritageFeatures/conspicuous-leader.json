You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<p><strong>Fight for Your Lives! </strong>As an action, you can push your allies to get that extra edge you need to survive. You and friendly creatures who can see and hear you within 30 feet may spend hit dice, rolling them and gaining temporary hit points instead of healing. A creature can spend a number of their hit dice in this way up to your proficiency bonus. Once you use this trait, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>\n<p><strong>Just Swing It! </strong>When you obtain this trait, choose one martial weapon. You and friendly creatures you can see and who can see you within 30 feet are proficient with this weapon and with shields.</p>",
