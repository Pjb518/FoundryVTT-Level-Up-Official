		"description": "<p>You&rsquo;ve drank from the cup of the blood lords, but your powers are only just awakening. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<p><strong>Fanged Bite.</strong>&nbsp;The bite is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes that deal equal to 1d4 piercing damage. Attack and damage rolls with your bite use your choice of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution modifiers.</p>\n<p>While you or your target are bloodied, you gain an expertise die on these attack rolls.</p>\n<p><strong>Blood Feasting.</strong> As part of a short rest, you can sink your teeth into the corpse of a Humanoid which has died within the past hour and drain it of blood. At the end of that rest, you regain a number of hit dice equal to your proficiency modifier (never exceeding your hit dice maximum). A corpse can be used for this trait no more than once. Once you have used this trait to regain a number of hit dice equal to your character level, you can&rsquo;t gain any more until you complete a long rest.</p>\n<p><strong>Wall Creeper.</strong> You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. At 3rd level, you are under a constant @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.kz3xe6ems34f2ubo]{Spider Climb} effect, which cannot be detected or dispelled by means short of a wish spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Special.</strong> This heritage gift counts as meeting the prerequisites for the Newblood synergy feat. Both of your bite attacks' damage increases per the benefits of the feat and those in its sequence, and they both use the best of your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution modifiers for attack and damage rolls.</p>",
