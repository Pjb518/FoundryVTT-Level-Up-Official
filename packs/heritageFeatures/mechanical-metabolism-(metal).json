Sources of nonmagical healing&nbsp;other than taking a rest have no effect.&nbsp;Magical healing only restores half as&nbsp;many hit points as normal unless you are&nbsp;also repaired in the same round (with an&nbsp;Engineering check, the mending cantrip,&nbsp;or similar).</p>\n<p>In addition, you don&rsquo;t require Supply&nbsp;in the typical sense; instead of eating&nbsp;food, you rely on a specific substance to&nbsp;refuel. Every 24 hours without the&nbsp;substance you suffer a level of fatigue and&nbsp;strife as your inner machinations begin to&nbsp;decay.</p>\n<p>Select one of the following.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Metal: </em>1 pound of copper or roughly 50 copper pieces. The Narrator may also allow you to consume silver, gold, or other precious metal in an amount of equivalent worth instead.</li>\n</ul>",
