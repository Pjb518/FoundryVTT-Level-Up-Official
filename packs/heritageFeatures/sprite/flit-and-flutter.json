You cannot fly if you are wearing armor that has a Strength requirement, if you are currently carrying an object that weighs a number of pounds equal to twice your Strength score, or if you are currently encumbered. You may, however, utilize magic items that increase your Armor Class and use light shields if you are proficient.</p>\n<p>If your movement speed is reduced to 0 or you are incapacitated, you fall at a rate of 30 feet per round.</p>\n<p>The rules for hovering still apply to you.</p>",
