You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<p><strong>Mimicry. </strong>Once you hear a noise, including when you hear a creature speak, you can mimic it perfectly. You gain an expertise die on checks made for vocal or auditory impersonation, and creatures have disadvantage on their Insight checks against them.</p>\n<p><strong>Rote Memory.</strong> Any words you can understand, written or spoken, you can recall with precision. You automatically succeed on checks made to recall such information, unless magic interferes with you. You gain an expertise die on saves made against effects that harm your memory, as well as on checks made to reproduce written or spoken information you know (such as with transcription or forgery).</p>\n<p><strong>Crow Artes. </strong>You are proficient with two skills of choice from Arcana, Acrobatics, Deception, Insight, Perception, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth.</p>",
