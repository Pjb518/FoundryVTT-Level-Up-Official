You have the following traits:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Venomous Bite.</strong></em> You have a venomous bite. As an action, you can attack with your bite (which is considered a finesse weapon) dealing piercing damage equal to 1d4 + ability modifier and poison damage equal to 1d4 + your proficiency bonus.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Rapid Bite.</strong></em> You can also bite much faster, forgoing the opportunity to inject venom. You may make a bite attack as a bonus action, dealing 1d4 points of piercing damage + your ability modifier (but no poison).</p>\n<p><em><strong>Poison Resistance.</strong></em> You are resistant to poison damage and have advantage on saves to avoid the poisoned condition.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Menacing Viper.</strong></em> You gain proficiency with the Intimidation skill.</p>",
