		"description": "<p>While in a settlement in which you can communicate with officers of the law, you can spend 1 hour to file an emergency injunction. This injunction compels a specific person to complete or cease a certain action in consistency with the law—such as “stay away from my horse” or “get your horses out of my stable.” The injunction is a legal order which will be enforced by the town guard, and it is considered law for one week after which time the emergency injunction wares out and it must be restored through the normal bureaucratic means.</p><p>Alternatively, you might instead file paperwork formally accusing a person of a crime or granting someone you know bail without payment. You can file no more than 1 emergency injunction per week.</p>",
