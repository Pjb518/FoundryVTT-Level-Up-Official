It moves when you do, with you at its center. The radius of the swarm decreases by 10 feet each time you are included within an area of effect that deals damage. The insects remain for 10 minutes, until the swarm’s radius is less than 10 feet, or it is dispersed by strong wind</p><p></p></li><li><p><em>Giant Insect</em> (4 charges)</p></li><li><p><em>Insect Plague</em> (5 charges)</p></li></ul><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p>The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6+4 expended charges each dawn.</p><p>When the last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff is destroyed as it transforms into a swarm of insects which immediately disperse.</p>",
