The corpse's knowledge is limited: it knows only what it knew in life and cannot learn new information or speak about anything that has occurred since its death. It speaks only in the languages it knew, and is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if it has reason not to. Answers might be brief, cryptic, or repetitive.</p>\n<p>This spell does not return a departed soul, nor does it have any effect on an undead corpse, or one without a mouth.</p>",
