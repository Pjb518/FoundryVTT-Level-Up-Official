When a command is spoken, the book stand&rsquo;s wing-like supports become a pair of feathery wings and it takes flight along with any book it currently holds. It will follow you, keeping the book at a convenient height for reading. The book stand has a maximum flight speed of 100 feet. If you are moving faster than the book stand can follow, it will follow as closely as it is able and attempt to catch up as rapidly as it can when you slow or cease your movement. The book stand can support a book weighing up to 10 pounds and still fly.</p>",
