		"description": "<p>Every trip to sea can become boring and one of the best ways to whittle away at the time — besides drinking rum—is to engage in a game of bones. Not every sailor on the high seas is honest and these dice were crafted with the devious amongst them in mind.</p><p>Each four-sided die is made from bleached white whale bone and inlaid with jet-black markings. No matter how many times they are thrown or the number of ship hulls they strike, the dice never nick or scuff, and their markings do not fade.</p><p>The dice have 2 charges and regain 1 charge each dawn.</p><p>When you speak the command word as a bonus action as the dice are being rolled, their results come up as double ones (or snake-eyes).</p><p>If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the dice will roll up as double ones but both dice then crack in half rendering them useless.</p>",
