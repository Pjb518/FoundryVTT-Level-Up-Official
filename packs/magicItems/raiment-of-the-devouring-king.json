		"description": "<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-magic-items.Item.yl585jzb1qfhwgty]{Cloak of the Devouring King}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-magic-items.Item.kb05g22xsf33pih6]{Crown of the Devouring King}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-magic-items.Item.s3rioxw6cpf79084]{Orb of the Devouring King}</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ancient beyond meaning, the Devouring King known as Nyth&rsquo;Zerogg spreads across the multiverse, infecting a plane with a portion of himself before consuming it. Whether summoned or drawn by hunger, the mind-bending entity crosses black seas of infinity to gorge upon mortal civilizations and gods alike.</p>\n<p>Rarely in the uncounted eons of his existence, the spore of the Devouring King is denied. In this reality primordial powers drove him back before he took root, destroying him almost completely. Of his titanic form only a piece of skull, a fragment of wing membrane, and a piece of its strange heart survived. Nyth&rsquo;zerogg&rsquo;s might was such that even these pieces contain terrible power, housing a fragment of his essence and a shard of his alien psyche.</p>\n<p>Since Nyth&rsquo;Zerogg&rsquo;s destruction pieces of the raiment have shown up throughout history, ultimately destroying their bearers and causing untold devastation. The destruction that they have wrought is insignificant compared to the danger that they pose however, as these artifacts hold the key to restoring the spore of Nyth&rsquo;Zerogg so that he may consume all reality.</p>\n<p>The Raiment of the Devouring King consists&nbsp;of three pieces: a cloak, a crown, and an orb. To&nbsp;attune to a piece, you must awaken it by pouring&nbsp;the blood of a recently sacrificed sapient creature&nbsp;onto it, allowing you to graft it to your body in a&nbsp;process that takes a minute, during which you are&nbsp;incapacitated by agony. Once attuned, pieces can&nbsp;only be removed if you are killed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Legends and Lore</h2>\n<p>Success on an Arcana or History check reveals&nbsp;the following:</p>\n<p><strong>DC 15</strong> This is part of the Raiment of the Devouring King, the remains of an ancient being who consumed worlds.</p>\n<p><strong>DC 18</strong> There are three surviving pieces of the raiment: a cloak, a crown, and an orb.</p>\n<p><strong>DC 21</strong> The cloak grants flight and teleportation, the crown transforms the wearer&rsquo;s body, and the orb enhances their mind.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Artifact Properties</h2>\n<p>While you are attuned to any piece of the Raiment&nbsp;of the Devouring King, you are subject to Malignant&nbsp;Influence (see below) and gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You cease aging and become immune to poison and disease.</li>\n<li>You gain a pool of 8 charges that can be spent to fuel the Raiment of the Devouring King&rsquo;s magical properties (save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). You regain 1d4+1 charges each dusk.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>A Complete Set</h2>\n<p>Because of their powerful desire to be together,&nbsp;no matter how many pieces of the Raiment of&nbsp;the Devouring King you wear they count as a&nbsp;single magic item for the purposes of attunement.&nbsp;For each additional piece of the Raiment of the&nbsp;Devouring King that you acquire, you gain the&nbsp;following benefits:</p>\n<p>Two Pieces. Your pool of charges increases to 12. You can use an action to regain 1 expended charge by messily devouring an incapacitated or unconscious creature within your reach, killing it in the process. Creatures slain in this manner&nbsp;can only be returned to life by means of a wish&nbsp;or true resurrection.</p>\n<p>Three Pieces. Your pool of charges increases to 16. When you take a short rest, you can extend tendrils into the ground and regain 1d4+1 charges by consuming natural energy within a 1-mile radius. All plant life in the area dies and beasts become poisoned while in the area. This property can only be used in an area once per decade, after which it cannot support life for the next 10 years.</p>\n<p>You cannot be permanently killed unless each piece of the raiment is cut from your body in conjunction with a carefully worded wish spell. Instead, you return to life [[1d3]] days later.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Malignant Influence</h2>\n<p>Each piece of the Raiment of the Devouring&nbsp;King longs to be united with the others so that&nbsp;Nyth&rsquo;Zerogg may live again. While attuned to a&nbsp;piece of the artifact, you must succeed on a DC&nbsp;18 Wisdom saving throw once per month or gain&nbsp;a level of Malignant Influence, which cannot be&nbsp;removed while you are attuned to the Raiment of&nbsp;the Devouring King. With two pieces of the artifact&nbsp;attuned, you repeat the saving throw once per&nbsp;week, and when all three pieces of the artifact are&nbsp;attuned, you repeat the saving throw once per day.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Level 1. </strong></em>You become obsessed with acquiring the other pieces of the Raiment of the Devouring King and devote all of the time and resources at your disposal to the task.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Level 2.</strong></em> You become ravenous and must consume one living sapient being each day or gain a level of fatigue that persists until you consume such a creature.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Level 3.</strong></em> You fall entirely under the sway of the Raiment of the Devouring King. You gain the Chaotic and Evil alignment traits, and you will stop at nothing to see Nyth&rsquo;Zerogg reborn. You immediately become an NPC under the Narrator&rsquo;s control.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Awakening Nyth&rsquo;Zerogg</h2>\n<p>If all three pieces of the Raiment of the Devouring&nbsp;King graft to a single host and they acquire three&nbsp;levels of Malignant Influence, the host&rsquo;s mind and&nbsp;soul are devoured as fuel for Nyth&rsquo;zerogg&rsquo;s reawakening.&nbsp;The exact consequences of such a reawakening&nbsp;are left to the Narrator but likely pose an extinction&nbsp;level threat to mortals and gods alike.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Destruction</h2>\n<p>Many attempts have been made to destroy pieces&nbsp;of the Raiment of the Devouring King, yet they&nbsp;always reform. Some believe that they can only&nbsp;be destroyed by plunging a creature with all three&nbsp;pieces of the artifact grafted to its body into the&nbsp;heart of a star or a true flame in the center of the&nbsp;Elemental Plane of Fire&mdash;though even this is just&nbsp;a theory.</p>",
