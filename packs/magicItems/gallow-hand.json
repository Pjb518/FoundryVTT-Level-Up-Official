The light shed by a gallow hand is only visible to its holder and is completely invisible to all other creatures.</p><p>Alternatively, all five fingers of the hand can be lit as an action. If the hand is lit in this way, it sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for a further 20 feet. This light is invisible to the holder but visible to all other creatures.</p><p>Any creature other than the holder that enters this area of light for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed. While charmed, a creature’s Speeds are reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.</p><p>Once lit in this way the gallow hand burns for 1 minute, after which it deteriorates into a molten nub.</p>",
