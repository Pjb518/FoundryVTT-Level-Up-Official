    "description": "<p>This crumpled vellum scroll is scrawled with an Infernal statement outlining the beliefs of a specific yet unnamed fiend. Whether or not you can read the language, while studying the statement you gain an expertise die on a Religion check made to recall or learn information about fiends. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p><p>By repeatedly reciting the creed aloud as an action each round for 1 minute, you can cast find familiar, except your familiar takes the form of either an imp or a quasit. The creed is irrevocably absorbed into the familiar’s body and is completely destroyed when the familiar drops to 0 hit points.</p><p><strong>Curse.</strong> The familiar summoned by the creed is cursed. The fiend who wrote the creed can observe you through the summoned familiar, and can command the familiar to take actions while you are asleep or unconscious.</p>",
