		"description": "<p><strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Glass used for divination magic, dream taken from the Astral Plane</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p>This elaborate 50 pound mirror hides an extradimensional prison beneath its smooth, silvery surface. </p><p>You can use an action to activate or deactivate the mirror by speaking its command word while within 5 feet. While active, when a creature other than you sees its reflection in the mirror while within 30 feet, it makes a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. Creatures that are aware of the mirror’s nature have advantage, and constructs automatically succeed. On a failure, the creature and all its possessions are trapped inside one of the mirror’s 12 extradimensional cells. </p><ul><li><p>Each extradimensional cell is an infinite plane filled with thick fog. Creatures trapped within do not need to eat, drink, or sleep, nor do they age.</p></li><li><p>Creatures can escape via planar travel, but are otherwise trapped until freed. </p></li><li><p>If a creature is trapped but the mirror’s cells are already full, a randomly determined trapped creature is freed so the new creature may be trapped.</p></li><li><p>While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to call forth a trapped creature. The creature appears in the surface of the mirror, allowing you and the creature to communicate normally.</p></li><li><p>A trapped creature can be freed by using an action to speak a different command word. The creature appears in an unoccupied space near the mirror and facing away from it.</p></li></ul><p>When the mirror (AC 11, 10 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning damage) is reduced to 0 hit points it shatters, freeing all trapped creatures. The creatures appear in unoccupied spaces nearby .</p>",
