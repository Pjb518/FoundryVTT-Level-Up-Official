The target gains this knowledge even if you do not share a language. When the effect ends, the target forgets the information you imparted.</p><p>This wand has 5 charges and regains [[/r 1d4+1 #charges]] expended charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a [[/r 1d20]]. On a 1, the wand fades from existence and you forget you ever owned it. <br></p>",
