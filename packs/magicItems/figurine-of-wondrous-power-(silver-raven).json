    "description": "<p>These small, palm-sized figurines of various animals run the entire gamut of artistic skill—some sculpted down to the last hair of detail and some looking more like the product of carvings by a drunkard.</p><p>The specifics of these figurines vary but they all work in essentially the same way: if you use an action to speak the appropriate command word and throw the figurine at a point within 60 feet, it transforms into a living creature the color of its original material. If the chosen space is occupied (either by creatures or non-living obstacles) the figurine does not transform.</p><p>It understands any language you can speak and follows your verbal commands. When not carrying out a task, the creature defends itself but does not otherwise act.</p><p>Each creature stays transformed for a specific duration, detailed in its individual entry. At the end of this duration, the creature turns back to its inanimate form. It also reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word while touching it. Once it has reverted to its figurine form, it cannot transform again for a specific length of time.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p>This silver raven statuette can become a mundane raven for up to 12 hours.</p><p>After this figurine has been used, it can’t be used again until 2 days have passed.</p><p>While it is in raven form, you can cast animal messenger on it at will.</p><blockquote><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>RAVEN</strong> (CHALLENGE 0)</p><p>TINY BEAST (0 or 10 XP)</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 12</p><p><strong>Hit Points</strong>: 1 (1d4-1)</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>: 10 ft., fly 50 ft.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>STR — DEX — CON — INT — WIS — CHA</strong></p><p><strong>2 </strong>(-4) <strong>14 </strong>(+2) <strong>8 </strong>(-1) <strong>2 </strong>(–4) <strong>12 </strong>(+1) <strong>4 </strong>(–3)</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Proficiency</strong>:<strong> </strong>+2; <strong>Maneuver DC</strong>: 12</p><p><strong>Senses</strong>: passive Perception 13</p><p><strong>Languages</strong>: —</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Mimicry<em>.</em></strong> The raven can imitate sounds it hears frequently, such as a simple phrase or an animal noise.
