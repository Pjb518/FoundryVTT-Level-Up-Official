It constantly emits a high-pitched whine that is uncomfortable to animals. Animals do not willingly approach within 10 feet of the staff without a successful DC 22 Animal Handling check.</p><p></p></li><li><p>Attacks with this weapon deal double damage against doors and other objects.</p><p></p></li><li><p>Once per day, you can use an action to slam it against the ground and generate a wave of thunder and force, either in a 10-foot radius or 30-foot cone. Creatures in the area take 3d6 thunder damage and are pushed 15 feet away. This effect cannot penetrate a <em>silence </em>spell (or any similar magical silence effect).</p></li></ul>",
