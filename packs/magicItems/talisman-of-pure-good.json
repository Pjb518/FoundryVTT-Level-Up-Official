		"description": "<p>This talisman’s purity harms creatures that do not have the Good trait, dealing 6d6 radiant damage when touched (or 8d6 radiant damage to a creature with the Evil trait). A creature carrying or holding this item takes the same damage at the end of each of its turns as long as it does so.</p><p>A cleric or herald with the Good trait can use this talisman as a holy symbol, which grants a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls while held or worn.</p><p>In addition, the talisman has 7 charges.</p><p>While wielded or worn, you can use an action to expend a charge and choose a target within 120 feet that is on the ground. If the creature has the Evil trait, it makes a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or is destroyed by a flaming pit that appears beneath it. Once the pit closes no trace of it or the target remains.</p><p>Once all charges are expended, the talisman collapses into golden specks of light.</p>",
