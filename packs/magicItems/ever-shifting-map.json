		"description": "<p>Created by a dwarven prospector who made it his life’s goal to map out as many of the deepest dungeons and tunnels as he possibly could, this tattered piece of parchment has a display of words and diagrams on it that is in constant flux.</p><p>When you attune to the map, the words change to the language of your choosing.</p><p>Whenever you examine the map, you can immediately find north no matter where you are, so long as you are on a plane of existence that has traditional cardinal directions</p><p> When you speak a command word etched on the back corner of the map while you are underground, you recall the memory of the dwarven prospector embarking on what he feared to be his last expedition, delving so deep that he thought he might never return. When this happens, the map shows you the direction to the largest cache of treasure (measured in number of coins and jewels) within 1 mile.</p><p>The map shows you passageways relevant to your destination and gives you advantage on ability checks to find secret doors, but does not note the location of monsters or traps.</p><p>The information on the map disappears after your next long rest, at which point all writing vanishes from the parchment and it becomes a mundane item.</p>",
