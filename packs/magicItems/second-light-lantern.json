    "description": "<p><em>Wondrous</em></p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p>Many humanoid races have darkvision but some find that this curious lantern (which can be a hooded lantern or bullseye lantern) is worth carrying all the same, particularly scholars and spies who often need the finest possible detail without revealing themselves to others.</p><p>When you light this lantern, you can expend 1 charge to shed second-light. Second-light is visible only to creatures with darkvision and they see the full range of colors in things illuminated by it.</p><p>Alternatively, you can expend 1d4 charges to shed a still more specialized light, visible only to those who are touching the lantern’s handle. This light lasts for a number of minutes equal to the charges expended.</p><p>The lantern has 4 charges and regains 1 charge each dusk. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the lantern loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.</p>",
