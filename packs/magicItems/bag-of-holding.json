		"description": "<p>This bag’s interior space is significantly larger than its apparent size of roughly 2 feet at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds and has an internal volume of 64 cubic feet. Regardless of its contents, it weighs 15 pounds. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action. If you have never interacted with a specific bag of holding before, the first time you use it, it requires 1d4 rounds to take stock of its contents before anything can be retrieved from the bag.</p><p>Food or water placed in the bag immediately and permanently lose all nourishing qualities — after being in the bag, water no longer slakes thirst and food does not sate hunger or nourish. In a similar fashion, the body of a dead creature placed in the bag cannot be restored to life by revivify, raise dead, or other similar magic. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive for up to 2d4 minutes divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.</p><p>The bag cannot hold any item that would not fit in a normal bag of its apparent size or any item with the Bulky quality.</p><p>If the bag is punctured, torn, or otherwise structurally damaged, it ruptures and is destroyed, and the contents are scattered throughout the Astral Plane. Placing a bag of holding inside another extradimensional storage device such as a portable hole or handy haversack results in planar rift that destroys both items and pulls everything within 10 feet into the Astral Plane. The rift then closes and disappears.</p>",
