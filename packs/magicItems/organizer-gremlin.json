		"description": "<p><strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Pen owned by a failed scribe</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p>This small black pocketbook comes with a tiny ethereal gold goblinoid who holds a cheap pen and eagerly awaits your instructions. Roughly half of this 120 page book is blank scratch paper, and the other half is a calendar of the current year. The gremlin writes down anything you ask it to and even takes down dictation if requested. It will also mark reminders in the calendar and circle dates. Despite its love for writing however, its penmanship is quite poor, it doesn’t actually  understand what anything it’s writing actually means, and any word with 3 or more syllables is always misspelled. Accurately understanding anything the gremlin has written requires a DC 10 Intelligence check. <br></p>",
