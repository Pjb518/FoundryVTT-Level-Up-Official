		"description": "<p>These small, palm-sized figurines of various animals run the entire gamut of artistic skill—some sculpted down to the last hair of detail and some looking more like the product of carvings by a drunkard.</p><p>The specifics of these figurines vary but they all work in essentially the same way: if you use an action to speak the appropriate command word and throw the figurine at a point within 60 feet, it transforms into a living creature the color of its original material. If the chosen space is occupied (either by creatures or non-living obstacles) the figurine does not transform.</p><p>It understands any language you can speak and follows your verbal commands. When not carrying out a task, the creature defends itself but does not otherwise act.</p><p>Each creature stays transformed for a specific duration, detailed in its individual entry. At the end of this duration, the creature turns back to its inanimate form. It also reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word while touching it. Once it has reverted to its figurine form, it cannot transform again for a specific length of time.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p>This bronze figurine is of a griffon in an aggressive posture.</p><p>It can become a griffon for 6 hours, after which it cannot be used again for 5 days.</p><blockquote><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>GRIFFON</strong> (CHALLENGE 3)</p><p>LARGE MONSTROSITY (700 XP)</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 12</p><p><strong>Hit Points</strong>: 57 (6d10+24; bloodied 28)</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>: 30 ft., fly 80 ft.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>STR — DEX — CON — INT — WIS — CHA</strong></p><p><strong>18 </strong>(+4) <strong>14 </strong>(+2) <strong>18 </strong>(+4) <strong>2 </strong>(–4) <strong>16 </strong>(+3) <strong>8 </strong>(–1)</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Proficiency</strong>:<strong> </strong>+2; <strong>Maneuver DC</strong>: 14</p><p><strong>Skills</strong> Perception +5</p><p><strong>Senses</strong>: passive Perception 15</p><p><strong>Languages</strong>: —</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p style=\"text-align: start\"><strong><em>Keen Sight.</em></strong> The griffon has advantage on Perception checks that rely on sight.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p style=\"text-align: start\"><em>ACTIONS</em></p><p style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>Multiattack<em>.</em></strong> The griffon attacks once with its beak and once with its talons.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>Beak<em>.</em></strong><em> Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 9 (2d4 + 4) piercing damage.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>Talons<em>.</em></strong><em> Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage, or 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage if the griffon started its turn at least 20 feet above the target, and the target is grappled (escape DC 14).
