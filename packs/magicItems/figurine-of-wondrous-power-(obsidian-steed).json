		"description": "<p>These small, palm-sized figurines of various animals run the entire gamut of artistic skill—some sculpted down to the last hair of detail and some looking more like the product of carvings by a drunkard.</p><p>The specifics of these figurines vary but they all work in essentially the same way: if you use an action to speak the appropriate command word and throw the figurine at a point within 60 feet, it transforms into a living creature the color of its original material. If the chosen space is occupied (either by creatures or non-living obstacles) the figurine does not transform.</p><p>It understands any language you can speak and follows your verbal commands. When not carrying out a task, the creature defends itself but does not otherwise act.</p><p>Each creature stays transformed for a specific duration, detailed in its individual entry. At the end of this duration, the creature turns back to its inanimate form. It also reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word while touching it. Once it has reverted to its figurine form, it cannot transform again for a specific length of time.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p>This rearing horse statuette can become a nightmare for up to 24 hours. It can be utilized as a mount, but fights only to defend itself.</p><blockquote><p>There is always a 5% chance per use that the steed ignores your orders, including commands that it return to figurine form. If you mount the steed during this time, it instantly teleports the two of you to a random location in Hell, whereupon it immediately reverts to figurine form.</p></blockquote><p>After this figurine has been used, it can’t be used again until 5 days have passed.</p><blockquote><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>NIGHTMARE</strong> (CHALLENGE 3)</p><p>LARGE FIEND (700 XP)</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 13 (natural armor)</p><p><strong>Hit Points</strong>: 68 (8d10+24; bloodied 34)</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>: 60 ft., fly 90 ft.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>STR — DEX — CON — INT — WIS — CHA</strong></p><p><strong>18 </strong>(+4) <strong>14 </strong>(+2) <strong>16 </strong>(+3) <strong>10 </strong>(+0) <strong>12 </strong>(+1) <strong>14 </strong>(+2)</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Proficiency</strong>:<strong> </strong>+2; <strong>Maneuver DC</strong>: 14</p><p><strong>Damage Immunities</strong> fire</p><p><strong>Senses</strong>: passive Perception 11</p><p><strong>Languages</strong>: understands Abyssal, Common, and Infernal but can’t speak</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p style=\"text-align: start\"><strong><em>Evil.</em></strong> The nightmare radiates an Evil aura.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: start\"><strong><em>Fiery Hooves.</em></strong> The nightmare sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
