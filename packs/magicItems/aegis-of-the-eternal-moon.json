		"description": "<p>The circular surface of this gleaming silver shield is marked by dents and craters making it reminiscent of a full moon. While holding this medium shield, you gain a magical +1 bonus to AC. This item has 3 charges and regains 1 charge each night at moonrise.</p><p>While this shield is equipped, you may expend 1 charge as an action to cast moonbeam, with the following exceptions: the spell manifests as a line of moonlight 10 feet long and 5 feet wide emanating from the shield, and you may move the beam by moving the shield (no action required). When the first charge is expended, the shield fades to the shape of a gibbous moon and loses its magical +1 bonus to AC. When the second charge is expended, the shield fades to the shape of a crescent moon and becomes a light shield, granting only a +1 bonus to AC. When the final charge is expended, the shield fades away completely, leaving behind its polished silver handle. When the shield regains charges, it reforms according to how many charges it has remaining.</p>",
