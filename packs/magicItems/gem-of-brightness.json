		"description": "<p>While you are holding this gem, you can speak one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>0 charges</strong>: The first command word can be used as a bonus action to cause the gem to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.</p><p>This effect doesn’t expend any charges and lasts until you repeat the first command word or use one of the other two.</p><p></p></li><li><p><strong>1 charge</strong>: The second command word requires an action, causing the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet. The creature makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or becomes blinded for 1 minute.</p><p>The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p></p></li><li><p><strong>5 charges</strong>: The third command word requires an action, causing the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or becomes blinded for 1 minute.</p><p>A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p></li></ul><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p>This prism has 50 charges. When all of the gem’s charges are expended it loses all magical properties, becoming a mundane jewel worth 50 gold.</p>",
