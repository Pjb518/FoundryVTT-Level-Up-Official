The target makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or you steal its voice.</p><p>As long as you are wearing the amulet, you can speak with the target’s voice.</p><p>For as long as you possess a target’s voice in the amulet, the target is unable to speak. At the end of every 24 hours, the amulet expends 1 charge per voice stored inside of it. When the amulet has no charges to expend, the stolen voice is released and returns to the target.</p><p>You can use a bonus action to release a voice stored in the amulet. When the amulet has no voices stored in it and is soaked in sea water for 24 hours, it regains 1 charge.</p><p>Destroying the amulet releases any stolen voices stored inside and creates a brief piercing shriek in a 100-foot radius. Each creature in the area must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the start of its next turn.</p>",
