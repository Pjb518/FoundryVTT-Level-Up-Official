    "description": "<p>This small hairy humanoid foot has been chemically preserved and attached to a simple chain necklace as a pendant. Whenever you roll a natural 1 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw while wearing this necklace, you may choose to reroll and must use the new result. Once you make a reroll in this way, you cannot do so again for the next 24 hours. In addition, halflings get an unnerving sense of this macabre trophy even when it is hidden, and while wearing this necklace you have disadvantage on all Charisma (Persuasion) checks to influence halflings.</p><p>Alternatively, these mortal remains can be buried or burned properly through halfling funerary rites taking 1 hour. If these rites are completed, any creatures in attendance (a maximum of 8) gain a point of inspiration.</p>",
