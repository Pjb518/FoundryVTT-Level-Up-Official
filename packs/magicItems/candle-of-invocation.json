		"description": "<p>This golden candle is infused with raw divine magic. When attuned to by a cleric or druid, it takes on a color appropriate to the cleric’s deity.</p><p>You can use an action to light the candle and activate its magic. The candle can burn for a total of 4 hours in 1 minute increments before being used up.</p><p>While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within the area who worships the same deity as the attuned creature (or at the Narrator’s discretion, an allied deity) has advantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. If one of the creatures gaining the prior benefit is also a cleric, druid, or herald, they can cast 1st-level spells from one of those classes at that spell level without expending spell slots.</p><p>Alternatively, one of these candles that has not yet been lit can be used to cast the<em> gate </em>spell. Doing so consumes the candle.</p>",
