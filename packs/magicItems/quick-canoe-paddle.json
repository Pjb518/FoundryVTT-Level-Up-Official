		"description": "<p><strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Giant octopus ink </p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p>This cocowood paddle has a long handle with a short but wide blade designed for long ocean voyages by canoe. Coats of lacquer on the paddle cause it to reflect light causing it to have an almost mirrored finish in the glare of the sun, and from a glance it’s hard to believe that it has ever spent a minute in the water.</p><p>This paddle has 2 charges and regains 1 charge each dawn. You can speak its command word as an action while using a water vehicle, doubling the vehicle’s speed until the start of your next turn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the paddle loses its magical properties and becomes a mundane item. <br></p>",
