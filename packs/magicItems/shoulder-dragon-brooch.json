		"description": "<p>Once attuned to this intricate golden brooch, you can imagine up to one dragon of your choice and a Tiny-sized illusion of it appears on your shoulders. The dragon looks lifelike and it occasionally flies, snaps at insects, and generally behaves in a dragon-like way. This illusion does not hold up to physical scrutiny and any creature who physically interacts with the dragon sees through the illusion with a successful DC 12 Investigation check. You can use a bonus action to dismiss the illusion.</p><p>As a bonus action, you can have your dragon illusion attack a creature within 5 feet of you. That creature must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d4 damage of a type of your choice (fire, lightning, cold, or acid) on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Once you have used this feature, it cannot be used again for 24 hours.</p>",
