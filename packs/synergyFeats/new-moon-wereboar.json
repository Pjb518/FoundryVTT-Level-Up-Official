While you are transformed, you gain the following features.</p><p><strong><em>Fleet of Foot.</em></strong> Your Speed increases by 10 feet.</p><p><strong><em>Relentless.</em></strong> Once between long rests when you take damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points, you are instead reduced to 1 hit point.</p><p><strong><em>Tusks.</em></strong> You gain tusk natural weapons you are proficient with. You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack rolls of your tusks. On a hit, your tusks deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 plus your Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier (whichever is highest).</p>",
