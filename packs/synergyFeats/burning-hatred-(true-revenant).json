		"description": "<p>You can use an action to target the focus of your Fearsome Pursuit if it is within 30 feet. The creature makes a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your highest mental ability score modifier). On a failure, it takes psychic damage equal to 1d6 × your proficiency bonus and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half damage and is rattled until the end of its next turn. Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><p></p><p><em>(A5E Foundry </em>- Must manually set saving throw highest mental stat.)</p>",
