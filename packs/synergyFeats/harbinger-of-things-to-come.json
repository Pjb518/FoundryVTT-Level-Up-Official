These special battle hymns can only be performed while you are using your voice Art Specialty as a spell focus.</p><p><strong><em>Preach Despair.</em></strong> A hostile creature within 60 feet of you suffers a level of strife. Creatures with an opposite alignment from yours or that worship a greater entity that has an opposite alignment suffer two levels of strife instead. A creature cannot suffer more than two levels of strife from Preach Despair in the same 24 hours.</p><p><strong><em>Preach Hope. </em></strong>Ally creatures within 60 feet gain advantage on saving throws. When the battle hymn ends, allies within 30 feet of you remove one level of strife. An ally that shares your alignment or worships a greater entity removes two levels of strife instead.</p>",
