You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Your Intelligence score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you finish a short rest in natural surroundings, you may un-prepare a number of wizard spells up to your ranger level and prepare an equal number of different wizard spells in their place.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>With an hour of searching in natural surroundings, you can find naturally-occurring items that carry the same magical resonance as a single spell component costing up to 5gp x your character level and may use them as a substitute for the material component of a single casting of that spell. This consumes the natural items, even if the spell component is not normally consumed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your spellbook is immune to fire damage and is not damaged by immersion in water.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You gain proficiency with your choice of the bookbinder&rsquo;s kit, alchemist&rsquo;s tools, or the herbalism kit.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
