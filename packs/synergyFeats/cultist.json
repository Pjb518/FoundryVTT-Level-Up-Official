In addition, choose 3 spells of 3rd level or lower from classes you do not have levels in. Each spell must be from a different class&rsquo;s list. While you have your book of shadows, these spells count as warlock spells for you and do not count against your spells known.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You gain an additional secret of arcana and an additional sign of faith. Neither counts against the maximum number of its respective type you can know.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
