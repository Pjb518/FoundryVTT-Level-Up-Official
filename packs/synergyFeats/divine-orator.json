		"description": "<p><strong><em>Prerequisites:</em></strong><em> Proclaimer feat</em></p><p>Proclaimers can use their oration skills to spread their version of ultimate truth into even the most stubborn of acolytes.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">You learn the Divine Inspiration and Persuasive Speech battle hymns. These special battle hymns can only be performed while you are using your voice Art Specialty as a spell focus.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\"><strong><em>Divine Inspiration.</em> </strong>When an ally within 15 feet hits a creature with a melee weapon attack, your ally can deliver a Divine Smite just as if you had delivered it yourself using your Divine Smite feature (expending one of your uses). If you are able to empower your smites, you may choose to empower it as normal.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\"><strong><em>Persuasive Speech.</em></strong>&nbsp;Hostile creatures within 60 feet take a –1d4 penalty on attack rolls. You can sustain this battle hymn for up to 3 rounds without expending additional uses of Bardic Inspiration. When a hostile creature begins its third consecutive turn within range of this battle hymn it becomes charmed by you and will not attack you or your allies. If this causes combat to end early, the creatures remain charmed by you for up to 1 minute afterward or until one of them is damaged by you or an ally. For the next 24 hours after the battle hymn ends, you gain an expertise die on Charisma checks made against creatures that were charmed in this way. A creature that either shares your alignment or worships a deity that has your alignment becomes charmed on its second consecutive turn instead. Creatures that have an opposite alignment or worship a greater entity that has an opposite alignment cannot be charmed in this way.</p>",
