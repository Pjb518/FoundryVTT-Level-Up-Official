		"description": "<p>While many sprites are beings of the woods and fields, some have taken up residence in more civilized areas, where they act as benevolent household guardians or cheeky mischief-makers. These hearth sprites, as they are known, are perpetually covered in the soot from cooking fires but are seldom seen outside of the small footprints and handprints they leave about the house, or the tiny gifts they set out for their housemates to find. They typically only show themselves to children, and are particularly protective of them.</p>\n<p>Hearth sprites often tuck themselves into the unseen corners of a home, sharing spaces with dust bunnies, lost coins, and other bits and bobs. They often collect these forgotten trinkets, turning them into furnishings, decorations, and even clothing and accessories.</p>\n<p>Characters raised in the hearth sprite culture share a variety of traits in common with one another.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Always Prepared.</strong></em> Your penchant for collecting odds and ends always seems to come in handy. You know the <em>preparedness </em>cantrip. This does not count against the number of spells you know.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Homemaker.</strong></em> You&rsquo;ve learned how to pick up on cultural traditions, particularly when it comes to peoples&rsquo; homes. You gain proficiency in Culture and an expertise die to recall knowledge regarding local traditions and superstitions.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Hideaway. </strong></em>You are a master of remaining out of sight. You gain an expertise die to checks made to hide. If you make this check while in a settlement or other urban area, you roll your check with advantage.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Languages. </strong></em>You can speak, read, write, and sign Common and one other language of your choosing.</p>",
