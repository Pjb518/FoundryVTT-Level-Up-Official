So long as you have two hours to work through junk yards and consignment shops, you can get almost any part or material component for 15% below market value.</p>\n<p><strong>Tightened Belt.</strong> On backwater worlds supplies can be scarce. You can go a number of days equal to half your Constitution modifier without suffering any fatigue from lack of Supply.</p>\n<p><strong>Versatile Skill.</strong> Living in a lonely world where the population tends to be very condensed into pockets of civilization means you often need to be self-sufficient just to make it through the day. You gain proficiency in Survival and one other skill of your choice.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can read, sign, speak, and write Common and one other language.</p>",
