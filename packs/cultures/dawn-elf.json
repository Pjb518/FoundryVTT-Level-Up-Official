		"description": "<p>Descended from eladrin of the Summer Court, dawn elves hold a particular affinity for the sun and the warmth of summer. They treasure their connections to the fey realms more dearly than some elf cultures, celebrating the riotous chaos that makes up the Summer Court. They hold a particular affinity for illusions, and illusion magic is pervasive in their communities. While they find such things amusing and charming, visitors to their villages often find themselves lost as front doors open to broom closets or mirrors suddenly become portals through which you may walk.</p>\n<p>Dawn elves are typically easygoing and quick to laugh, and their festivals and gatherings are always full of warmth and light. Dance factors heavily into their culture, and in many cases causes for celebration are honored through dance.</p>\n<p>Characters raised in the dawn elf culture share a variety of traits in common with one another.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Kindred of the Courts.</strong></em> You are proficient in Performance and one other skill of your choosing from the following list: Arcana, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, or one musical instrument of your choice.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Enthralling Dancer.</strong></em> You gain an expertise die to Performance checks made to dance. When you successfully perform the busk journey activity, you earn twice as much gold.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Illusionist.</strong></em> You learn the minor illusion cantrip. Additionally, your familiarity with illusions makes them easier for you to spot. You gain an expertise die to checks made to see through illusory effects.</p>\n<p><em><strong>&nbsp;Languages: </strong></em>You may speak, read, write, and sign in Common, Elvish, and one additional language of your choosing.</p>",
