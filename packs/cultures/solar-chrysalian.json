		"description": "<p>Raised in the warmth of the sun, solar chrysalians are often characterized by their boisterousness and joie de vivre. They often dress themselves in loud patterns and colors, and frequently favor sequins, feathers, bells, and other baubles that draw attention. Friendly and vivacious, they are attracted to bright colors and hubs of activity and are always on the lookout for the next new and exciting thing. As such, they tend to be more itinerant than other chrysalians, with many forming wandering groups or performing troupes that range all across the fey realms and beyond. Because of this cultural desire to wander, solar chrysalians are the most likely to venture furthest from the fey realm&rsquo;s borders in search of adventure.</p>\n<p>Characters raised in the solar chrysalian culture share a variety of traits in common with one another.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Artistic Inclination.</strong></em> You have proficiency with one type of artisans&rsquo; tools of your choice and one instrument of your choice.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Cultural Savant.</strong></em> Because you spend so much time around others, you are especially adept in social situations. You gain proficiency in two of the following skills: Culture, Deception, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion.</p>\n<p><em><strong>I Meant to Do That. </strong></em>The playful magic you have been surrounded by all your life means you are capable of shrugging off failure, even if it&rsquo;s catastrophic. Once per long rest, if you fail a roll on a d20 for an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check, you can reroll the die (or one die, if you rolled with advantage or disadvantage). You must use the result of the new roll.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, write, and sign Common, Sylvan, and one other language of your choosing.</p>",
