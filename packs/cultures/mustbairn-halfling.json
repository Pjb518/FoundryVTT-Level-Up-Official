You ignore&nbsp;<span class=\"freelinking-link\">difficult terrain</span> caused by any form of earth or soil, such as mud, or mountainous terrain. In addition, you know the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.5o1rvwzxmsh5ji9i]{druidcraft} cantrip.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Earthspeak.&nbsp;</em></strong>You can attempt to divine the earth&rsquo;s wisdom (as the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.qsa7b22n3y1pbzf6]{augury} spell) by submerging your feet or hands into mud or soil. Once you divine the earth&rsquo;s wisdom in this way, you can&rsquo;t use this trait again until after you finish a long rest.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Wild and Unshackled.</em></strong>&nbsp;Mustbairns have embraced everything that law and order works against, and have learned to live freely amongst nature. You have the Chaotic alignment for the purposes of any spell or ability that would detect or effect Chaotic creatures. In addition, you gain proficiency with two of the following skills: Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Nature, Religion, or Survival.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong>&nbsp;You can speak, read, sign, and write Common, Halfling, and Terran.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Source: Adventurer's Guide</em></p>",
