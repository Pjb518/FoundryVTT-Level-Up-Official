Creatures attempting to make Intimidation or Persuasion checks vs. a creature from a warped culture do so at disadvantage.</p>\n<p><strong>Ghostly Allies.</strong> The ghosts which the warped interact with are able to impart information. You may ask the Narrator one yes/no question, which they will answer truthfully. Once you have used this feature you cannot use it again until you take a long rest.</p>\n<p><strong>Warped Psionics. </strong>Choose one psionic reflex. You are able to use this reflex even if you have no psionic class features. Once you have used this feature you cannot use it again until you take a long rest.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can read, sign, speak, and write Common and one other language.</p>",
