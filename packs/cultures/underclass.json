You gain an expertise die to Deception, Persuasion, Stealth and disguise kit checks made to pose as a servant (such as custodial crew, wait staff, or the like), likely granting you access to areas where you would otherwise be unable to access, and to move unobtrusively through such spaces (though doing so still likely requires an appropriate uniform or other prop). Additionally, you gain an expertise die on Stealth checks to blend into crowds.</p>\n<p><strong>Good in a Pinch.</strong> You are used to defending yourself by whatever means available. You are proficient with improvised weapons.</p>\n<p><strong>One Step Ahead. </strong>Growing up on the wrong side of everything has taught you to be hyper aware of authority figures. You gain an expertise die to Insight and Perception checks made to spot active-duty law enforcers, such as police and security, and to discern plainclothes police, undercover security, and the like as being in disguise.</p>\n<p><strong>Pull Together.</strong> Relying and being relied upon by your community makes you adept at lending a hand. You can perform the Help action as a bonus action.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can read, sign, speak, and write Common and one other language.</p>",
