		"description": "<p>Cast forward in time, you find yourself a stranger in a strange land. The places you once knew, the streets you once roamed, are little more than ruins, if even that. Just as likely you’ve appeared in a trackless waste, or the settlement of a people that you do not know, that you could scarcely have imagined existing mere hours before.</p><p>And it is into this new world that you must adapt yourself. Have spent years trying to adapt. To take what you learned in your earliest memories and combine them with this strange new world’s teachings. The world your parents built is gone, and they may be, as well. But the lessons they shared still hold some weight. Some resonance. Some truths continue into this new world.</p><h2>Adapted Education</h2><p>Choose one trait from the dominant culture of the region you landed in at the end of your temporal displacement. You gain this trait as if you were a member of that culture.</p><h2>Lived the Past</h2><p>You gain proficiency in the Arcana or History skill, and expertise in either Forbidden Knowledge or Legends.</p><h2>Temporal Refugee</h2><p>Choose one trait from any culture to represent your family’s culture before your displacement. You gain this trait as if you were a member of that culture.</p><h2>Languages</h2><p>You are able to read, sign, and write the Common tongue, or an appropriate dominant language for the region you arrived in, one language of your choice, and one dead language that only members of your people ever spoke aloud.</p>",
