As long as an ally is within 60 feet of you, you always know their general location even if you cannot see or otherwise sense them. This effect is blocked by 1 foot of lead or iron and magical effects like the<em> </em>@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.yaoaihxyt4dlsysw]{nondetection} spell.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>It Takes a Village</em></strong>.&nbsp;You can use the Help action as a bonus action. Additionally, when you do so, the range at which you can Help an ally increases to 15 feet. Once per&nbsp;<span class=\"freelinking-link\">long rest</span>&nbsp;when you Help an ally, in addition to granting&nbsp;<span class=\"freelinking-link\">advantage</span>&nbsp;you may also choose for your ally to gain an&nbsp;<span class=\"freelinking-link\">expertise die</span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong>&nbsp;You can speak, read, write, and sign Common, Gnomish, and one other language.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Source: Adventurer's Guide</em></p>",
