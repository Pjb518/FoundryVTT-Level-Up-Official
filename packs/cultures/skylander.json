		"description": "<p><span lang=\"EN\">Instead of living with your head in the clouds, you have come down to earth to struggle with the rest of the mortals. Your homeland floats far above the land. It might have been an island wedged in the sky by arcane forces, a forgotten kingdom sequestered in the air for its own protection, or even an ancient flying castle.</span></p><p><span style=\"text-indent: 36pt; font-size: 10.5pt;\">Little is known about your people, and skylander culture varies radically from setting to setting. A great many skylanders are farmers and scholars, just trying to live a peaceful life. Others are pirates and raiders, looking to other aerial (or landbound) resources to plunder. Some skylanders denounce the skypirate lifestyle, others embrace it as the true expression of skylander culture.</span></p><h3><span lang=\"EN\">Skylander Traits</span></h3><p>Characters raised in the skylander culture share a variety of traits in common with one another.</p><p><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">Aerial Magic.</span></em></strong><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"text-indent: 9pt; font-size: 10.5pt;\"> You know the <em>mage hand</em> cantrip, and when you cast it the hand is invisible, replaced by a faintly glowing wind. You can use this trait once between long rests to cast one spell, chosen from <em>air wave</em>, <em>feather fall</em>, or <em>floating disk</em>. Once you reach 3rd level, you can do so twice between long rests. Your spellcasting ability for these is your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.</span></p><p><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">Aerial Privateer.</span></em></strong><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"text-indent: 9pt; font-size: 10.5pt;\"> You are proficient with air vehicles.</span></p><p><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><em><span lang=\"EN\">Skylander Education.</span></em></strong><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"text-indent: 9pt; font-size: 10.5pt;\"> You are proficient with one skill from Animal Handling, Arcana, Engineering, Medicine, Nature, and Religion.
