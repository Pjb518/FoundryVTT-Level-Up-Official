		"description": "<p>A sister culture to the dawn elves, dusk elves are descended from eladrin of the Winter Court. Relatively recent arrivals to the Material Plane, many dusk elves maintain more fey-like traits, such as slightly pointed canines and eyes that shine in the dark. This, along with their ties to the lands of perpetual twilight, mean that many distrust the dusk elves on principle&mdash;a distrust that may or may not be earned on an individual basis.</p>\n<p>This sense of distrust is further compounded by the fact that, unlike their warm and lively cousins the dawn elves, dusk elves tend to be reserved and aloof by comparison. While dusk elves are typically slow to trust, once that trust is earned one finds themselves brought into a very close-knit community that can be fiercely protective, particularly against unseen threats.</p>\n<p>Characters raised in the dusk elf culture share a variety of traits in common with one another.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Natural Guile.</strong></em> You are proficient in Arcana and gain an expertise die to recall forbidden knowledge. Additionally, you gain proficiency in one of the skills from the following list: Deception, Intimidation, Stealth, or Survival.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Superior Darkvision. </strong></em>The range of your darkvision increases to 120 feet. If you did not have darkvision already, you instead gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet. While in the dark, your eyes shine like a cat&rsquo;s if exposed to dim light.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Winter&rsquo;s Blessing.</strong></em> You learn either the chill touch or ray of frost cantrip. This does not count against the spells you know.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You may speak, read, write, and sign in Common, Elvish, and Sylvan.</p>",
