		"description": "<p>The fomorians (singular: fomor) are a subterranean kingdom of half-giants who consider themselves the one true culture of&nbsp;giantkind. They are known for surface raids, subterranean territory disputes, and astounding underground marble architecture&mdash;especially abandoned cities now infested with aberrations. In what little territory they still control, fomorians live in isolated city-states ruled by hereditary god-kings who promise the people the glory of ages past.</p><p>At the end of the Golden Age of Giants, mortals began worshiping the gods and stopped worshiping the elementals&mdash;and by extension the giants who claimed to be their emissaries. The pro-giant nationalist movement which became the fomorians, looking for a kingdom where they could keep practicing things &ldquo;the way they are,&rdquo; sought to establish a new empire in the Underland... But the denizens of the Underland had different ideas. It was not long before the unified fomor empire was smashed to bits. The city- states which remain are but a shred of what their predecessors had hoped would have formed a great fomorian tapestry.</p><p>The friendliness of fomor enclaves vary, and most could be called insular at best. Some fomor city-states embody the most noble (even if haughty and propagandized) traditions inherited from giantkind. Others are openly xenophobic. Given the proximity and conflict with the aberrations that live in the Underland, some scholars hypothesize that the most vicious fomor groups are those under the influence of (or co-opted entirely by) aboleths and their ilk.</p><p>Both through their own inclination and through aberrant influences, fomorians practice a type of alchemy that mutates their body and enhances their strengths&mdash;most especially a magical capability called &ldquo;the evil eye.&rdquo;</p><p>Fomorians who would consider joining an adventuring party might include: raiders looking for treasure, sages investigating changes to the surface world, seekers on a spiritual quest, diplomats, and survivors of attacks from alien invaders.</p><h3>Fomor Traits</h3><p>Characters raised in the fomor culture share a variety of traits in common with one another.</p><p><strong>Ancient Heritor.</strong> You are proficient in History, plus one History specialty of your choice.</p><p>Improved Darkvision. Prolonged exposure to sheer darkness has improved your capacity to see without light. If you do not already have darkvision, you gain darkvision out to 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, the distance improves by 60 feet.</p><p><strong>Magic of the Evil Eye.</strong> You know the cantrip chill touch. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast bane once per long rest. At 5th level, you can cast mental grip once per long rest. You don&rsquo;t need material components for these spells, and when casting them your spellcasting ability is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (whichever is highest).</p><p><strong>Shadow Giantcraft.</strong> You gain proficiency with both poisoner&rsquo;s kit and smith&rsquo;s tools.</p><p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, write, and sign Common, Undercommon, and Giant.</p>",
