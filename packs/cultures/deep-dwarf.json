		"description": "<p>Deep dwarves make their homes underground, far from most other creatures and from the sun. Their communities are the most isolated of all dwarven cultures. Some of them refuse trade even with other dwarves. Those that do trade, however, quickly realize that some goods they grow underground cannot live on the surface, and vice versa. Deep dwarf beer is unique, prized across all other dwarven cultures and many other peoples.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Living so isolated and surrounded by dangerous monsters makes these people extremely cautious and calls for specialized training. While hammers and axes are similar to tools dwarves use, they are not much use in the cramped environments deep dwarves navigate.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mountain dwarves are adapted to underground living but the deep dwarves even more so, with the ability to see clearly in the darkest depths. They are a pessimistic culture, distrustful and often cruel, with a society that emphasizes adversarial relationships even amongst kin. Most deep dwarf adventurers are exiles, cast out for breaking a cynical code of behavior.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Characters raised in the deep dwarf culture share a variety of traits in common with one another.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Superior Darkvision.&nbsp;</em></strong>You grew so used to being underground that you can see in the dark farther than other dwarves.&nbsp;The range of your darkvision increases to 120 feet. If you didn&rsquo;t have darkvision already, you gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Deep Magic.&nbsp;</em></strong>You know the<em>&nbsp;<span class=\"freelinking-link\">resistance</span>&nbsp;</em>cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.ieyjztbqemom7ups]{jump}<em>&nbsp;</em>once per long rest. At 5th level, you can cast @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.ap6klied8mqbclvn]{enlarge/reduce} once per <span class=\"freelinking-link\">long rest</span>&nbsp;. You don&rsquo;t need material components for these spells, but you can&rsquo;t cast them while you&rsquo;re in direct sunlight (although sunlight has&nbsp;no effect on them once cast). Intelligence is your&nbsp;<span class=\"freelinking-link\">spellcasting ability</span>&nbsp;for these spells.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Deep Suspicion.&nbsp;</em></strong>Your lack of trust protects you from some magic.
