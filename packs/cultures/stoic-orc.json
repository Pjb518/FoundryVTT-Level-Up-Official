You gain proficiency with one of the following skills: Arcana, History, Insight, Medicine, Nature, or Religion.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Ritualistic Focus.&nbsp;</em></strong>Many of the stoic rituals you learned have broader arcane applications. You know two 1st-level spells of your choice. These spells must have the ritual tag and you may only cast them as rituals. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells. In addition, you may cast other spells you learn as rituals if those spells have the ritual tag.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Languages.&nbsp;</em></strong>You can speak, read, write, and sign Common and Orc.</p>",
