You are proficient with two martial weapons of your choice and with light armor. You are also able to cobble together functional if somewhat ramshackle weapons from whatever you have on hand. You can create a ramshackle version of any simple weapon (except crossbows) with 10 minutes of work if you have access to simple materials such as common household items, the rusted scraps found among battlefields, or the bounty of the forest. Ramshackle weapons created in this way function identically to their normal counterparts, except their gold value is always 0 and they break and become useless on a critical fumble.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Wartime Scrounger.</em></strong>&nbsp;Once per&nbsp;<span class=\"freelinking-link\">long rest</span>, you can spend 4 hours of time to locate Supply&nbsp;for yourself and one other creature while traveling through urban environments, warzones, and battlefields.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Languages</em></strong>. You can speak, read, write, and sign Common and one other language.</p>",
