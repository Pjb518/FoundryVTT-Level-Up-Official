		"description": "<p>Most sprites are beings of the woods and wild places, and wood sprites are no different. Their communities are often found in the densest forests among toadstool rings and the most vibrant fields of wildflowers.</p>\n<p>One of the defining characteristics of wood sprite culture is their connection to corgis. These spirits that are summoned from the fey realms serve as faithful mounts for the otherwise Tiny sprite people, allowing them to cover far greater distances than their wings would normally allow. Outsiders often remark that the corgi&rsquo;s foxlike face is proof that the fey can trick anyone&mdash;provided that it&rsquo;s cute enough.</p>\n<p>Characters raised in the wood sprite culture share a variety of traits in common with one another.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Ally of Beasts. </strong></em>You gain proficiency in Animal Handling, or an expertise die if you were already proficient.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Faithful Friend.</strong></em> You reach into your natural connection with the fey realms and summon a faithful steed or companion. As an action, you may summon a fey spirit that takes the form of a corgi. &nbsp;The corgi uses the statistics below. If you are Tiny, you may use the corgi as a mount. If you are larger, the corgi functions as a familiar. If the corgi is reduced to 0 hit points, it disappears, and you must use your action to re-summon it. You may also dismiss the corgi as a bonus action.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Natural Compass.</strong></em> So long as you are outdoors and above ground, you always know which way is north.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, write, and sign Common and Sylvan.</p>",
