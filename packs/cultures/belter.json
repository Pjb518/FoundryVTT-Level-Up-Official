		"description": "<p>Characters raised in the belter culture share a variety of traits in common with one another.</p>\n<p><strong>All Hands on Deck.</strong> From an early age you got to know the machines of your asteroid hopper, and as you grew up you were instructed on their care and maintenance. You gain proficiency in the Engineering skill and space vehicles. In addition, when you undertake the Repair journey activity, you count your result as one higher. Critical failures become failures, failures become successes, and successes become critical successes. If you roll a critical success, you can remove an additional critical malfunction of your choice.</p>\n<p><strong>Gauge Threat. </strong>Growing up on asteroid hoppers and the space stations where you dropped your cargo, you learned how to pick out the petty toughs from the actual threats. You can use an action to make either an Insight check against a DC equal to the target’s passive Deception check score (or an Engineering check in the case of androids and other constructs) against a creature you can see within 60 feet. On a success, you learn the creature’s Challenge Rating. (or level in the case of a creature with character levels).</p>\n<p><strong>Vent-Rat.</strong> As a child and young adult you got skilled at hiding in cramped spaces, particularly if you were boarded. You gain an expertise die when making a Stealth check in cramped spaces and can move at full speed while squeezing.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can read, sign, speak, and write Common and one other language.</p>",
