You are proficient with pistols and rifles. You also have proficiency with land, air, and space vehicles.</p>\n<p><strong>Sheltered Education.</strong> Those at the safe center of empires often have privileged access to fine teachers and the opportunity to follow academic interests that might otherwise be too impractical. You gain proficiency in History and either Culture, Nature, Performance, or Religion.</p>\n<p><strong>Station in Society.</strong> As a citizen of the empire you benefited from some measure of station that those outside your society did not. When interacting with merchants from a sector associated with your empire, you are able to use your station to secure a 10% discount on most goods and services.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can read, sign, speak, and write Common and one other language.</p>",
