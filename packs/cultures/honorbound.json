		"description": "<p>Characters raised in an honorbound culture share a variety of traits in common with one another.</p>\n<p><strong>Gentler Pursuits.</strong> While combat and physical capabilities are important to your culture, there is little respect for one who spurns intellect and beauty. You are proficient with your choice of either Culture, Performance, two musical instruments, or two artisanâ€™s tools.</p>\n<p><strong>Peak Performance.</strong> You have trained relentlessly to become a paragon of physical capability. Choose two from Athletics, Acrobatics, or Intimidation. You are proficient with the chosen skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Save Face.</strong> You are careful not to show weakness, lest your capabilities or dedication be questioned. If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check, you can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum +3), possibly changing a failure into a success. Once you use this trait, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p><strong>Weapon Training.</strong> You have been taught the ways of combat from an early age. You gain proficiency with 2 martial weapons of your choice and with starship weapons.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can read, sign, speak, and write Common, plus one other language.</p>",
