You are proficient with improvised weapons.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Tall Tales.&nbsp;</em></strong>Life along the crossroads rarely offers an opportunity for proper schooling, but the roads carry with them legends and stories from far and wide. You may always choose to use Wisdom when making History, Nature, or Religion checks. However, the Narrator may decide that the results of a check made in this way are distorted or exaggerated forms of the truth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Village Watch.&nbsp;</em></strong>You gain an expertise die on Perception checks made while keeping watch during a rest.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Languages.&nbsp;</em></strong>You can speak, read, sign, and write Common and one other language.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Source: Adventurer's Guide</em></p>",
