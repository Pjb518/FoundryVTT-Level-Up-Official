This stacks with Technological Attunement, if applicable.</li><li>You have built your spellbook to last. It can be stolen or deliberately destroyed, but it cannot be incidentally damaged by fire, water, or the like.</li><li>When you perform the Spellcraft activity to research artificer or wizard spells during downtime, you gain an expertise die on the roll and the time and materials costs are reduced by 25%.</li><li>You may attune to a spell scroll with a wizard or artificer spell of a level no higher than the highest-level artificer spell you can cast as a spell invention with a fizzle die of 1d4. When the scroll fizzles, it is destroyed.</li></ul>",
