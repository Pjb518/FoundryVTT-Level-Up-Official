You gain the following additional Battle Hymn options, which are only usable while you are in your War Dance:</p><ul><li>Infectious Dance. Choose one creature within 30ft that can see you. You may cast the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.gitnhp5bf3rcee0b]{Wild Irresistible Dance} rare spell on them, benefitting from any active art specialties or masteries if appropriate, requiring a seen instead of a vocalized component, and requiring no concentration beyond that of the battle hymn. &nbsp;A creature that saves against this battle hymn is immune to it for 24 hours. &nbsp;This battle hymn lasts up to 1 minute, but ends early if you start a different battle hymn or if your War Dance ends.</li><li>Shared Dance. All allies within 60ft benefit from any adept dances you benefit from until the start of your next turn.</li></ul>",
