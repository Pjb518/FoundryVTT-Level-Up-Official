		"description": "<p>Most clerics receive at least some training in religious doctrine, either through formal instruction, divine revelation, or by having it shoved in their faces by entities that will not be ignored. &nbsp;Theologians go far beyond this, dedicating themselves to studying their faith, and more broadly the concept of religion and faith in general, with a scholar&rsquo;s dedication and thirst for knowledge. &nbsp;Philosophers of religion, there are some who joke that a theologian understands dogma better than the gods they serve, and while that is almost certainly an exaggeration their dedication does reap divine blessings and reward. You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain a +1 bonus to your choice of your Intelligence or Wisdom score, to a maximum value of 20.</li><li>You gain proficiency with religion if you do not already have it. &nbsp;If you are already proficient, you gain an expertise die on religion checks. &nbsp;Either way you also gain an additional skill specialty in religion. &nbsp;You may always use either wisdom or intelligence on religion checks, your choice.</li><li>Once per short or long rest, you may spend 1 minute in prayer and expend a hit die to make a DC 20 religion check using either intelligence or wisdom. &nbsp;If successful, you regain an expended use of channel divinity.</li></ul>",
