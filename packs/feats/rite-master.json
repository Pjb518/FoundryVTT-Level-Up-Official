When you acquire this feat, you create a ritual book holding two 1st-level spells of your choice from that class’ spell list. These spells must have the ritual tag. The class you choose also determines your spellcasting ability for these spells: Intelligence for wizard, Wisdom for cleric or druid, Charisma for bard, herald, or sorcerer, or your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma for warlock.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">If you come across a spell with the ritual tag in written form (like on a <em>spell scroll</em> or in a wizard’s spellbook), you can add it to your ritual book if the spell is on the spell list for the class you chose and its level is no higher than half your level (rounded up). Copying the spell into your ritual book costs 50 gold per level of the spell and takes 2 hours per spell level.</p>",
