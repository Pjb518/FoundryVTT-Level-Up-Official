    "description": "<p>Some berserkers have their emotions burn wild, reaching beyond them when they rage to drive allies forth and assault the minds of enemies. Some of these take this even further, honing this latent talent beyond their rage into real psionic ability, though they never forget where their power truly comes from. &nbsp;You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain a +1 bonus to your choice of your Strength or Intelligence score, to a maximum value of 20.</li><li>While raging, you may choose to use Raging Projection and Mind Strike as part of the same bonus action. &nbsp;If you use Raging Projection to grant an ally temporary or rage hit hit points they function independently, but if you use it to damage a creature, you add psychic damage equal to the damage of your Raging Projection to the damage of your Mind Strike as a single source of damage, affecting any of the same creatures. If your Mind Strike misses or the target saves and they would normally take no damage, they instead still take damage equal to your Raging Projection.</li></ul>",
