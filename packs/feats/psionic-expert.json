		"description": "<p>It is not uncommon for scholars to, in their most contemplative studies, awaken psionic ability. &nbsp;Some view this as merely a distraction to be ignored, but for others, it is a new horizon of studies they throw themselves into mastering. &nbsp;Likewise, many Espers are not content to merely practice their mental abilities, but seek mastery through truly understanding them, with a scholar&rsquo;s rigor. &nbsp;Both are psionic experts. &nbsp;You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You may add your intelligence modifier to concentration checks made for scholar abilities, psionic powers, or attack modes for your mind strike. &nbsp;</li><li>Additionally, whenever you make an ability check or saving throw using intelligence, you may expend a die from your psi reservoir. &nbsp;You may roll this die and add it to the result. &nbsp;You may choose to do so after the roll is made but before the result is declared. &nbsp;A die is recovered on a maximum roll and lost on a roll of 1 or 2 when used in this way as normal.</li><li>Finally you gain proficiency with the Awakened Mind combat tradition if you are not already. &nbsp;If you are, you gain proficiency in another tradition from the scholar list. You learn one awakened mind combat maneuver that does not count against your normal limit of maneuvers known.</li></ul>",
