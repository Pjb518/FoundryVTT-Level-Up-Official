You can only use this benefit on yourself. If you do, your number of available Lay on Hands points is reduced by 10 when you finish the long rest.</li>\n<li>Half your adept levels count as herald levels for the purpose of the Sacred Aura and Greater Sacred Aura features.</li>\n<li>Half your herald levels count as adept levels for the purpose of the Empty Mind feature.</li>\n</ul>",
