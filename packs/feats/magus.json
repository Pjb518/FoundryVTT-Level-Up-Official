This is applied after the benefit from Broad Magic.</li><li>You may apply Flexible Thinking to prepared witch spells as well, but only for spells on both the witch and wizard spell lists. &nbsp;You may use this ability twice per short or long rest, once each for wizard and witch prepared spells.</li><li>You may freely take any wizard elective study whenever you would gain a magical mystery, or a magical mystery anytime you would gain an elective study, and add half your wizard level to your witch level for the purpose of magical mysteries.</li><li>If you have the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.6l4bmc7ovgcn2c9k]{Find Familiar} spell in your wizard spellbook, you may add your wizard level to your witch level for the purpose of your witch's familiar ability.</li></ul>",
