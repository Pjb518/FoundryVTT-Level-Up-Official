You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Your Strength, Wisdom or wielder spellcasting ability score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Half your wielder levels count as druid levels for the purpose of the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.3jdfihvtbyhbv9ez]{Wild Shape} feature.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Half your druid levels count as wielder levels for the purpose of the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.iq8cqiia40rs54os]{Spellsword} feature and you can use it with druid spells in addition to wielder ones.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">You gain an additional benefit based on the type of @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.i6yg9jmich8u6jjx]{Bonded Artifact} you have chosen:</p>\n</li>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">If your bonded artifact is an @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.l97xnqcpxnc12jpo]{Armor of Power}, you can use and wear it as normal, and retain proficiency with it, superseding the usual limitation for druids, even if it is made of metal. It merges into your form as usual when you wild shape. Additionally, when you are wildshaped, add half your proficiency bonus to your form&rsquo;s AC, as the essence of your artifact protects you.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">If your bonded artifact is a @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.00ein6jo2oc0asex]{Font of Power}, it functions as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells as well as your wielder ones. You also learn an additional cantrip of your choice from the druid list, which does not count against your druid cantrips known.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">If your bonded artifact is a @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.uga2gmf3559332tw]{Weapon of Power}, when you wildshape, it transfers some of its power to the natural weapons of your form, granting them attack and damage bonuses equal to half your proficiency bonus.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
