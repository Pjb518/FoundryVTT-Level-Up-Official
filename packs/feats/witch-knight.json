You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain a +1 bonus to your Charisma score, to a maximum value of 20.</li><li>If your witch spellcasting ability modifier is not charisma, you may change it to charisma.</li><li>You gain proficiency with the cutting omen combat tradition.</li><li>You gain the Hands of Healing magical mystery if you do not already have it. &nbsp;If you do, you may choose a Magical Mystery or Divine Lesson of your choice. &nbsp;The points from this pool and your Lay on Hands pool are combined together.</li><li>Anytime you gain a divine lesson or magical mystery, you may gain one of the other instead, and may add your herald and witch levels together for the purpose of qualify for them.</li><li>You may expend a use of divine sense to cast the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.kaye34nheyrit487]{Detect Magic}, @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.jlqrjd03lyl8zb3c]{Detect Evil and Good}, or @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.4colmy0s3zjs0hy8]{Detect Poison and Disease} spells.</li><li>You may deliver your Lay on Hands or Hands of Healing effects through your familiar as if they were a touch spell.</li></ul>",
