		"description": "<p>The wilds are your domain and your authority is recognized by all who live there. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your Dexterity, Wisdom, or Charisma score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>\n<li>Your ranger levels count as marshal levels for the purpose of gaining the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.8mqtpdstwwedaxwq]{Stronghold} feature, but if your marshal levels alone are not enough to gain the feature, the stronghold must be a menagerie, encampment, or sacred grove. You cannot gain a second stronghold with this benefit, regardless of your mix of levels.</li>\n<li>Creatures of the Beast and Plant types recognize your authority.\n<ul>\n<li>When initiative is rolled, you can make a Persuasion check against a hostile Beast or Plant creature within 120 feet with a DC of 10 + the creature&rsquo;s CR to convince it to leave. If you succeed, the creature departs, leaving you and your allies in peace. At the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion, this benefit may not work on creatures under magical compulsion, infected with diseases that make them more aggressive, or the like.</li>\n<li>As long as you do not mistreat them, wildlife within a radius equal to your proficiency bonus in miles of any stronghold you possess are friendly to you and will help you in whatever ways they can. Predators will occasionally bring you a fresh kill, bees will allow you to harvest honey without stinging, deer will deliberately cut tracks that you can follow, crows will warn you of the presence of suspicious individuals with loud cawing, and so forth. At the very least, this grants you advantage on Survival checks in wilderness areas inhabited by friendly wildlife and may confer other benefits at the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You learn the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.6l4bmc7ovgcn2c9k]{Find Familiar} spell and can cast it as a ritual.</li>\n<li>Half your ranger levels count as marshal levels for the purpose of gaining the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.pe75gctv6xbrzzno]{Dauntless} feature.</li>\n</ul>",
