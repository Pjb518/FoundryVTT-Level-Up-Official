You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Half your rogue levels count as herald levels for the purpose of gaining the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.u220f22b3cpphtgb]{Empowered Smite} and @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.p9gkawegqqbxb821]{Greater Empowered Smite} features.</li>\n<li>Half your herald levels count as rogue levels for the purpose of gaining the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.0k3qurx2exzg127v]{Shrewd Judgment} and @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.p5l9usj384rd1qaf]{Low Profile} features.</li>\n<li>You gain the @UUID[Compendium.a5e-mmv2.mmv2-features.Item.YI5WDhayPcMU0Twi]{Savvy} or @UUID[Compendium.a5e-mmv2.mmv2-features.Item.6kekhTfs5h0X2LJ3]{Subtle} benefit that you did not choose with the @UUID[Compendium.a5e-mmv2.mmv2-features.Item.lZEDcgkf2nA7kmoz]{Activist} feat.</li>\n<li>You become maddeningly inscrutable to anyone but your friends and allies. Any time a hostile NPC tries to recall your identifying features and would not normally need to roll to do so, they must make a DC 10 Intelligence check (subject to the penalties below) to do so. Anyone hostile to you or who does not know you well (Narrator&rsquo;s discretion) trying to pick you out of a crowd, recall descriptive information about you, or even call your facial features to memory suffers a -1d6 penalty on the roll. This does not affect attack rolls or Perception checks to simply notice you are there; you can be seen just fine. It&rsquo;s memory and nuance that prove elusive.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>",
