You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You may enter a Rage and a state of Unfettered Emotions as part of the same bonus action, expending uses of these abilities as normal. &nbsp;If you do so you gain the benefit of both abilities, and the temporary hit points granted by your Unfettered Emotions are rage hit points instead. You may also add half your esper level to your berserker level for the purpose of the maximum number of rage hit points you may have at one time, but only while in both a rage and a state of Unfettered Emotions, as well as the number of times you can rage per long rest.</li><li>If you have Infectious Fury you may choose to grant bonded creatures the benefits of Unfettered Emotions instead of rage, but only if you are entering both states yourself.</li><li>If you have Unfettered Influence, it lasts for the normal duration of 1 minute, but only if you are also raging.</li></ul>",
