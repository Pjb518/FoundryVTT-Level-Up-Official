The curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target dies, you die, or you become incapacitated. The curse has the following effects: </p><ul><li><p>When you deal damage against the cursed creature, it takes an additional 1d4 radiant damage. This bonus increases by 1d4 when you have 10 combined levels of herald and warlock, and again when you have 15 and 20 combined levels of herald and warlock.</p></li><li><p>You have a pool of challenge dice, which begins empty. Whenever the cursed creature targets something other than you or itself with an attack, spell, or other feature, add one challenge die to this pool. When you or a friendly creature within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or saving throw, you can spend a challenge die to add 1d4 to the roll. The pool disappears when you finish a short or long rest.</p></li></ul><p>Once you have used this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
