When you spend 10 minutes speaking inspirationally, you can choose up to 6 friendly creatures (including yourself) within 30 feet that can hear and understand you. Each creature gains temporary hit points equal to your level + your Charisma modifier. A creature can’t gain temporary hit points from this feat again until it has finished a short or long rest.</p>",
