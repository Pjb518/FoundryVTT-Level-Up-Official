Wizard spells gained in other ways, such as on normal level up or by copying from a scroll or spellbook, are limited by your wizard level as normal. If you choose to learn one of these bonus spells normally, either on wizard level up, by copying a scroll or spellbook, or through some other means, you may choose a new bonus spell in its place.</li><li>You gain one additional Elective Study and Scholarly Discovery of your choice.</li></ul>",
