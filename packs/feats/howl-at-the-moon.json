You can also cast <em>animal friendship</em> without spending material components, but are only able to target animals of the same type as your curse. Once you have used this feature to cast <em>animal friendship</em>, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a long rest. In addition, you have advantage on Charisma checks made against animals when the moon is full.</p>",
