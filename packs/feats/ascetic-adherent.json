You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom, or Charisma score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>\n<li>Choose three weapons with a base damage die of a d8 or smaller that you are proficient with. They become adept weapons for you.</li>\n<li>Your adept levels count as herald levels for the purpose of the Extra Attack feature.</li>\n<li>You gain an additional benefit based on the Adroit Defense option you selected:\n<ul>\n<li>If you selected Agile Defense, you can use Charisma instead of Wisdom when calculating your AC. You can also spend points from your Lay on Hands pool to grant yourself temporary hit points on a 1-1 basis up to your proficiency bonus. These temporary hit points last until you begin a long rest.</li>\n<li>If you selected Brutal Defense, you can use it with medium armor. You can also ignore the prohibition against using medium armor and/or a shield with the Martial Arts feature and with Adept Speed and any other Practiced Techniques that depend on it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",
