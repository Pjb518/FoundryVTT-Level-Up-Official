Nature has a magic all it&rsquo;s own, and some immerse themselves in this magic body and spirt, blurring the line between witch and druid. &nbsp;You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You gain a +1 bonus to your Wisdom score, to a maximum value of 20.</li>\n<li>If your witch spellcasting ability modifier is not Wisdom, you may change it to Wisdom.</li>\n<li>You may add half your witch level to your druid level for the purpose of your wildshape feature.</li>\n<li>You gain the Scholar of Old Ways Natural Demeanor option if you do not already have it, or a different option if you do.</li>\n<li>You may freely take any druid secret of nature whenever you would gain a magical mystery, or a magical mystery anytime you would gain a secret of nature, and add half your druid level to your witch level for the purpose of magical mysteries.</li>\n</ul>",
