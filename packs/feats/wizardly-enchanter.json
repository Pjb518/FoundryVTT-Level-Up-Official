You learn them as Wizard spells and add them to your spellbook, even if they aren&rsquo;t normally on the Wizard list. If they are not on the normal Wizard list, other Wizards cannot copy them from your spellbook.</li><li>When you use Arcane Recovery, you can choose to repair a spell invention at the cost of a spell slot of the level of spell tied to it. For example, repairing a spell invention that casts blur would count as recovering a 2nd-level spell slot. You may only repair one spell invention this way per use of Arcane Recovery.</li></ul>",
