If you do, you may treat half your bloodblade levels as witch levels for the purpose of what potions you can make.</li>\n<li>You may treat half your witch levels as bloodblade levels for the purpose of the size of expertise die you gain to @UUID[Compendium.a5e-bloody-heretics.bloody-heretics.Item.eSbauOXs2C1ajtDf]{Blood Frenzy} saves from @UUID[Compendium.a5e-bloody-heretics.bloody-heretics.Item.48Ylu9lwmwAuhcF7]{Alchemical Balm}.</li>\n<li>You may exchange uses of Witch's Brew and Alchemical Balm for a use of the other ability. When using a use of Alchemical Balm to create a Witch's Brew potion, each potion takes 10 gold to create and costs 10 gold for basic options. If a potion would require witch level 13 it instead costs 20 gold, and if it would normally require witch level 17 it costs 40 gold. If using a use of Witch's Brew to create an Alchemical Balm, it does not cost any gold, but you must choose to do so over the course of a long rest when you prepare your other brews.</li>\n<li>You may freely take any bloodblade @UUID[Compendium.a5e-bloody-heretics.bloody-heretics.Item.o8OLFET0ceh9GSWy]{Esoteric Art} whenever you would gain a @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.vmkfr5u0neendp2v]{Magical Mystery}, or a Magical Mystery anytime you would gain an Esoteric Art, and add half your witch level to your bloodblade level for the purpose of Esoteric Arts and half your bloodblade level to your witch level for the purpose of Magical Mysteries.</li>\n</ul>",
