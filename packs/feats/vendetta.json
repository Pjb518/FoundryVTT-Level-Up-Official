You are utterly dedicated to defeating the source of your vendetta, often an organization like a thieves’ guild, the minions of a dreadful foe like a dragon or lich, or the army of a powerful ruler like a tyrant king. You gain an expertise die on attack rolls and initiative checks made against creatures that are part of your vendetta, and when making a saving throw to resist an attack, feature, maneuver, spell, or trait from a creature that is part of your vendetta. Whether or not a creature is part of your vendetta is at the Narrator’s discretion.</p>",
