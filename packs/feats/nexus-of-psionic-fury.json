Even as you send out waves of passionate emotion to your allies, you also allow them to borrow your other psionic abilities. &nbsp;You gain the following abilities:</p><ul><li>If an ally is bonded to you via the Infectious Fury ability or has temporary hit points from your Raging Projection, they may use any of your psionic powers as if they possessed them. If they wish to augment one of these powers, they may draw from either their psi dice if they have any or yours. If another creature uses one of your psi dice to augment a power used in this way, the die is lost on a roll equal to or less than half the maximum on the die, and you do not regain a die on a roll of maximum.</li><li>You may concentrate on any Mind Spike attack modes or psionic powers while raging.</li></ul>",
