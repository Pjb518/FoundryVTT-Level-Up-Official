You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Your Wisdom score increases by +1, to a maximum of 20.</li><li>You can enhance your training with a boost of divine power. When you use <em>Stride and Seek</em>, you may spend a use of <em>Channel Divinity</em>.<ul><li>If you are using <em>Hunter&rsquo;s Target</em>, the bonus damage increases to 2d6.</li><li>If you are using <em>Swift Feet</em>, it lasts for 10 minutes and your movement increases by 5 feet for the duration.</li></ul></li><li>Gain an additional&nbsp;<em>Exploration Knack</em> or <em>Sign of Faith</em> of your choice. It does not count against your maximum number known, and in the future, when you would select a <em>Sign of Faith</em>&nbsp;or <em>Exploration Knack</em>, you can choose from either list.</li></ul>",
