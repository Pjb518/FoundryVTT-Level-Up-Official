You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your Dexterity or Wisdom score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>\n<li>Once per short or long rest, when you cast a witch spell as a ritual, you can salvage some leftover components and make them into a healing item. You gain a salve as per @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.mv2l8c514nj60krl]{Healing Salves} knack or a dose of herbal bitters as per the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.785ufl4m9omqp1kw]{Herbal Bitters} knack. You do not have to have the knack in question to gain the item produced by this benefit.</li>\n<li>You learn the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-maneuvers.Item.wgqhr8fisrynnnvl]{Ricochet} maneuver; it does not count against your maneuvers known.</li>\n<li>Your familiar can mark targets for you. As an action, your familiar can pick a creature within 120 feet that it can see to mark as a target. The creature makes a Charisma save against your witch spell save DC. On a failure, it is outlined in a @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.z7r6plq6vyesck07]{Faerie Fire} effect for one minute. Once your familiar has used this benefits, it can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</li>\n<li>When you are in a wilderness setting, you can tap into the magic of the wilderness to enhance your magical knowledge, gaining an expertise die on Arcana checks. If you are in an area of potent magical energy such as a Sacred Grove stronghold, this expertise die increases by 1 step.</li>\n</ul>",
