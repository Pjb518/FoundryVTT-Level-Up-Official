Similar to scholar abilities, this does not count as actually casting a spell. Furthermore, you may attempt a DC 15 nature check as an action to regain a use of wild shape. &nbsp;Each time you do this, the DC for subsequent attempts cumulatively increases by 5, and once you fail a check you cannot attempt to do so again until you finish a long rest.</li><li>You may add half your scholar levels to your druid level to determine the effect of your wild shape ability, including access to @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.86p2i6t3jepq1c3q]{Improved Natural Bond} and @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.y5r5pal11p8i9laz]{Greater Natural Bond}.</li><li>You also gain a @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.l3qkjox9faldupcy]{Druidic Lore} ability of your choice.</li></ul>",
