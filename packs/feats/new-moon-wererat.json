		"description": "<p>You have learned to tame the rat within and gained some control over the curse of lycanthropy. On full moon nights you involuntarily change into a rat or rat-humanoid hybrid. While you are transformed, you gain the following features.</p><p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> You gain a bite natural weapon you are proficient with. You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack rolls of your bite. On a hit your bite deals piercing damage equal to 1d4 plus your Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier (whichever is highest).</p><p><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.</p><p><strong><em>Keen Smell.</em></strong> You have advantage on Perception checks that rely on smell.</p>",
