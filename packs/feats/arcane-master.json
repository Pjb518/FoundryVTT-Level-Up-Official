You have more spell knowledge than a sorcerer and more versatility with the spells you know than a wizard, but you also have a narrower range of magic available to you. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a spell is on both the sorcerer and wizard class lists for you, you treat your sorcerer levels as wizard levels for determining whether you can add it to your spellbook and cast it. You may only learn new spells using this benefit by purchasing or finding them; you cannot gain them by leveling up. Spells learned via leveling up use the level of their respective class normally.</li>\n<li>You treat half your sorcerer levels as wizard levels for the purpose of the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.iqlgotutphoratct]{Arcane Recovery} feature.</li>\n<li>When you use Arcane Recovery, you also recover sorcery points equal to your Intelligence modifier.</li>\n</ul>",
