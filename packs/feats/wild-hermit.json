You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You gain a +1 bonus to your choice of your Intelligence or Wisdom score, to a maximum value of 20.</li>\n<li>You gain an expertise die on nature and survival checks. &nbsp;You may always choose to use either intelligence or wisdom for nature or checks, your choice. &nbsp;You also gain an additional specialty in nature checks.</li>\n<li>You gain your choice of additional @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.sygit0xifd4lbg3g]{Natural Demeanor} option.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Finally, any time a scholar ability requires you to expend a hit die, you may spend a use of wild shape instead.</li>\n</ul>",
