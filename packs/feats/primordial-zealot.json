You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your Strength or Charisma ability score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>\n<li>You gain an additional maneuver from the combat tradition you selected as part of the @UUID[Compendium.a5e-mmv2.mmv2-features.Item.UpjNL3RuBIpgqEAd]{Classical Devotee} feat. It does not count against your maneuvers known.</li>\n<li>When you spend exertion, the next weapon attack you hit with on the same turn deals 1 point of additional damage of a type your @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.uit7l3mc64l5h8h1]{Elemental Blast} can do for each point of exertion spent this turn.</li>\n<li>You gain the following Channel Divinity feature:</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Infuse Shield</h3>\n<p>As a bonus action, spend a use of Channel Divinity, choose a type of damage you can deal with your Elemental Blast, and touch a shield you are wielding, infusing it with elemental energy. The infusion lasts for one minute, until you stop wielding the shield, or the energy is discharged as described below. The next time a creature hits you with a melee attack while your shield is infused this way, the energy discharges, blasting the creature that hit you, which must make a Dexterity saving throw against your maneuver DC. A creature that fails its save takes damage as if you had hit it with your Elemental Blast and is rattled until the end of its next turn. A creature that succeeds on its save takes half damage and is not rattled.</p>",
