		"description": "<p>You have both made stark improvements to your personal siege weapon, and developed new, even greater weapons of near total destruction, gaining the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When using your personal siege weapon, you have learned to load it with specialized ammunition. You may load it with alchemist's fire, an acid flask, or a single black powder charge. &nbsp;On a hit it deals normal damage plus the additional effect of the loaded item. &nbsp;Alchemist's fire and acid flask function as if you had hit with them, black powder charge immediately detonates on a hit with the area centered on the target of the attack.</li>\n<li>In addition, you develop three extra powerful but extra complex personal siege weapons. &nbsp;These take 10 minutes to setup or stow, and while operating one your movement speed is reduced to 5 ft per round, and these weapons require both hands to operate. &nbsp;You develop all three, though you may not always have all three with you. They each weigh 100 lbs and count as a bulky item. &nbsp;They cannot be loaded with additional specialized ammunition as above. &nbsp;They otherwise count as a personal siege weapon for you.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reflective Death Ray:</strong> This weapon can only be used outdoors in sunny conditions, or in places with a similarly bright source of unobstructed light (such as can be found on some other planes or generated by certain magical sources such as the daylight or sunbeam spell). &nbsp;If the source powering it counts as sunlight, so do attacks with the ray. As an action, you may create a beam of focused light 60 ft. long and 5 ft wide. &nbsp;Creatures in the area must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. &nbsp;On a failed save they take 6d8 radiant damage, and on a successful save they take half. &nbsp;The ray cannot move and fire in the same round, as it must be recalibrated to refocus the light.</li>\n<li><strong>Ratcheting Heavy Arbalest:</strong> This functions as a heavy arbalest, except it may preload up to 15 shots at a time. &nbsp;Loading it takes an action, and while so loaded it may fire as if it did not have the loading property. &nbsp;Alternatively, you may expend all preloaded bolts in one round as an action. &nbsp;If you do so, you create a 90 ft cone. &nbsp;Creatures that enter that cone or start their turn in it must make a dexterity saving throw, taking 2d10 on a failed save or half on a success, and the area of the cone is difficult terrain until the start of your next turn.</li>\n<li><strong>Alchemist's Dragon: </strong>This weapon can use an action to spray alchemist's fire in a 60 ft cone. &nbsp;Creatures in the area must make a dexterity save with a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. &nbsp;On a failed save, they take 4d6 fire damage and begin taking ongoing fire damage as if they were hit by alchemist's fire, using the normal DC for the item. &nbsp;On a success, they take half damage and do not catch on fire. &nbsp;It also ignites unattended flammable objects in the area. &nbsp;Each shot uses 5 flasks worth of alchemist's fire as ammunition.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",
