If you originally chose the sea lion stat block for seal form, it is replaced with your choice of either a walrus or a stellar sea lion. If you originally chose the seal stat block, it is replaced with your choice of either an elephant seal or a leopard seal stat block. You cannot later change your choice.</p>\n<p>You may also choose to take this feat in place of a heritage gift. If you do so, you may later choose to gain a selkie heritage gift as though it were a feat.</p>",
