Reconciling these two disparate power sources will take some doing, but you have started the process and already seen results. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your Constitution, Intelligence, or Wisdom score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>\n<li>Half your bloodblade levels count as druid levels for the purpose of the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.3jdfihvtbyhbv9ez]{Wild Shape} feature.</li>\n<li>Half your druid levels count as bloodblade levels for the purpose of the Hemocratic Call feature.</li>\n<li>When you are selecting wild shape forms, you can choose the creature type associated with your bloodblade archetype. You must still abide by CR limits.</li>\n<li>When you are in Blood Frenzy, you can spend a use of Wild Shape to end the frenzy if you would be forced to attack a friendly creature. If you do, you either shift into one of your wild shape forms (if you are in your default forms) or from your wild shape back to your default form (if you are wild shaped) as part of the process. If you have no uses of wild shape remaining, you cannot use this benefit.</li>\n</ul>",
