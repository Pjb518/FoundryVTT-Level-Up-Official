If your attack would normally have the Breaker property, it stacks with this benefit, dealing quadruple damage instead.</li>\n<li>You can spend a point of exertion to cast a spell from one of your spell inventions while raging. You can do this only once per rage.</li>\n<li>You gain an additional Grinding Cog maneuver. It does not count against your maneuvers known.</li>\n</ul>",
