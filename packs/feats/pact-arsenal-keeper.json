		"description": "<p>Encased in a protective artifact and wielding a fearsome weapon granted by a supernatural bargain, you are not to be trifled with. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When wearing your @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.l97xnqcpxnc12jpo]{Armor of Power} and wielding your pact weapon, you become more resilient.\n<ul>\n<li>Whenever you take damage, it is reduced by an amount equal to half your proficiency bonus. If a single source deals multiple types of damage, you can choose which type to reduce.</li>\n<li>You cannot be disarmed of your pact weapon while wearing your Armor of Power.</li>\n<li>You gain a second reaction each round that can be used only to cast a spell of the <em>abjuration </em>school.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If your pact weapon is a melee weapon, it gains the Parrying property. If it is also one-handed, it gains the Defensive (any) property. If it is ranged, its range increases by 30 feet.</li>\n<li>When you score a critical hit with your pact weapon, you gain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus + your warlock spellcasting modifier which last until you begin a rest.</li>\n<li>Your pact weapon becomes flexible and mercurial. Choose a number of weapon forms equal to your proficiency bonus. While you are wielding your pact weapon, you can spend an artifact charge (no action required) to change your weapon to one of the other forms. When your proficiency bonus increases, you gain an additional form. You must be able to wield the weapon in its new form to use this benefit. For example, if you have a shield equipped, you could not transform your weapon into a two-handed weapon such as a longbow or glaive until you have stowed it. You may use this ability between your attacks with the weapon if you desire, but you must provide ammunition normally for its ranged form(s).</li>\n</ul>",
