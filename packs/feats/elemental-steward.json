In either case, you have begun to learn to combine them.&nbsp;You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain a +1 bonus to your choice of your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score, to a maximum value of 20.</li><li>You may use your elementalist spell points and artifact charges interchangeably.</li><li>You gain an additional benefit based on the form your bonded artifact takes:<ul><li>If your bonded artifact is a <em>Weapon of Power</em>, it deals an additional d4 of damage on a successful attack. This damage type may be any type you can produce with your Elemental Blast feature.</li><li>If your bonded artifact is an <em>Armor of Power</em>, it is charged with elemental energies. Creatures grappling or grappled by you take 1d6 points of damage at the start of their turn. This damage type may be any type you can produce with your Elemental Blast feature.</li><li>If your bonded artifact is a <em>Font of Power</em>, it functions as a spellcasting focus for both your wielder and elementalist spells, and it also allows you finer control over the elements. Choose an additional Elemental Adaptation you qualify for. As long as you have your Artifact of Power in hand, you can use this Elemental Adaptation, and it does not count against your maximum number of Elemental adaptations known.</li></ul></li></ul>",
