Moving in this way doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.</p></li><li><p>On the first turn that you start with 0 hit points and must make a death saving throw, you make that saving throw with advantage.</p></li><li><p>When you take massive damage that would kill you instantly, you can use your reaction to make a death saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, you instead fall unconscious and are dying.</p></li><li><p>Medicine checks made to stabilize you have advantage.</p></li><li><p>When a creature successfully stabilizes you, at the start of your next turn you regain 1 hit point. Once you have used this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p></li></ul>",
