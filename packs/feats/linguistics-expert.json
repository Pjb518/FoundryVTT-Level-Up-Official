Anyone who knows the cipher can encode and read hidden messages made with it; the apparent text must be at least four times longer than the hidden message. Other creatures can detect the presence of the cipher if they spend a minute examining it and succeed on an Investigation check against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, they can read the hidden message.</p></li></ul>",
