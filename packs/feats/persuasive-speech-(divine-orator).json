You can sustain this battle hymn for up to 3 rounds without expending additional uses of Bardic Inspiration. When a hostile creature begins its third consecutive turn within range of this battle hymn it becomes charmed by you and will not attack you or your allies. If this causes combat to end early, the creatures remain charmed by you for up to 1 minute afterward or until one of them is damaged by you or an ally. </p><p>For the next 24 hours after the battle hymn ends, you gain an expertise die on Charisma checks made against creatures that were charmed in this way. A creature that either shares your alignment or worships a deity that has your alignment becomes charmed on its second consecutive turn instead. Creatures that have an opposite alignment or worship a greater entity that has an opposite alignment cannot be charmed in this way.</p>",
