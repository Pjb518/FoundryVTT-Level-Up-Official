You may only choose spells on both the wizard and witch spell lists for signature spells higher level than your wizard level alone would qualify for, but may choose any spell in your wizard spell book or on the witch spell list for those your wizard level alone would qualify for.</li><li>You gain one option from the wizard Spell Intensity ability.</li></ul>",
