This potent combination can lay low powerful foes and bolster allies in unique ways, making them sought-after individuals in times of peril.</p>\n<p>You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>When you cast a spell with a casting time of one action that targets a single creature and that grants the target an expertise die or advantage, removes a condition, increases its armor class, adds to its speed, or grants it temporary hit points, you may draw on your Lay on Hands pool to heal it as part of the same action. You need not touch the creature to use this ability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You may spend sorcery points to fuel your Lay on Hands ability. As a bonus action, you may spend any number of sorcery points to add three times as many points to your Lay on Hands pool. You may not perform this conversion in reverse.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Half of your sorcerer levels count as herald levels for the purpose of gaining access to combat maneuvers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You gain an additional manifestation: Purity (Radiant)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
