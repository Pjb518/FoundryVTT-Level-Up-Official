You need not touch the creature to use this ability.</p></li><li><p>You may spend sorcery points to fuel your Lay on Hands ability. As a bonus action, you may spend any number of sorcery points to add three times as many points to your Lay on Hands pool. You may not perform this conversion in reverse.</p></li><li><p>Half of your sorcerer levels count as herald levels for the purpose of gaining access to combat maneuvers.</p></li><li><p>You gain an additional manifestation: Purity (Radiant)</p></li></ul>",
