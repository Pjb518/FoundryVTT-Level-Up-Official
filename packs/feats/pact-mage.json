You also gain proficiency with your choice of the Cutting Omen or Mist and Shade combat traditions and three 1st- or 2nd- level maneuvers from the chosen tradition. Your pact weapon serves as a spellcasting focus for your warlock and wizard spells, and you choose two cantrips of the <em>weaponry </em>school to learn.</li>\n<li>If you have @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.f2mfiz8spijbzs6h]{Pact of the Chain}, you can now have two familiars at the same time. You and both of your familiars are all in constant telepathic communication with each other as long as you are on the same plane. Your familiars can cast any of your @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.iojeid79x6ghgcw9]{Signature Spells} by spending warlock spell points.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>If you have @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.2dp9b4a11fuxjwbc]{Pact of the Tome}, your book of shadows and your wizard spellbook merge into the same book. If it is lost, when you replace it, it returns with all of the contained spells still inside it. You immediately learn all of the spells from your expanded spell list as wizard spells, even if they do not normally appear on the wizard spell list. You also treat spells on the warlock list as wizard spells for the purpose of determining what spells you can learn as a wizard. If a spell does not normally appear on the wizard list, other wizards cannot learn it from your spellbook.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",
