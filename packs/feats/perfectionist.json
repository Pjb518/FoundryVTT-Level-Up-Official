Temporarily gaining a spell in this way costs a number of sorcery points equal to the spell&rsquo;s level. You cannot gain a spell in this way that has a level higher than your highest level spell slot. When you gain a witch spell in this way, it is considered prepared for the day. When you gain a sorcerer spell in this way, it is considered a spell you know for the day. You lose all spells gained in this way whenever you finish a long rest.</li></ul>",
