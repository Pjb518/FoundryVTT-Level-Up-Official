		"description": "<p>Your bonded artifact allows you to advance the ideals in which you so passionately believe in ways you never dreamed of when you took it up. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You gain proficiency with your choice of the Cutting Omen or Sanctified Steel combat tradition and learn a 1st-degree maneuver from the chosen tradition. It does not count against your maneuvers known.</li>\n<li>When you use @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.21aui3hwla5ykw3i]{Charged Exertion}, you can also heal yourself out of your @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.my42mip0qc35rcp2]{Lay on Hands} pool as part of the same process. The maximum amount you can spend out of your Lay on Hands pool at once this way is equal to your proficiency bonus.</li>\n<li>Half your herald levels count as wielder levels for the purpose of gaining the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.ukdth285bnj3w3qc]{Relic's Focus} feature, and you can use it with herald spells as well as wielder ones.&nbsp;<br>The power of your conviction infuses your bonded artifact. What form this takes depends on the artifact.\n<ul>\n<li>If your artifact is a @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.uga2gmf3559332tw]{Weapon of Power}, when you use @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.c6aiq8cd90fo3ry1]{Divine Smite}, you can spend an artifact charge to reroll any damage dice that come up as 1. You must use the new roll.</li>\n<li>If your artifact is an @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.l97xnqcpxnc12jpo]{Armor of Power}, when you use Lay on Hands to heal a creature other than yourself, you gain temporary hit points equal to half the damage healed. These temporary hit points last until you begin a short or long rest.</li>\n<li>If your artifact is a @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.00ein6jo2oc0asex]{Font of Power}, you learn the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.eiek2vbzwijd0qac]{Thaumaturgy} cantrip (or another cantrip of the radiant or healing school if you already know it) and when you cast a spell of the radiant school of at least 1st level, you can choose to shed bright light in a radius equal to 10 feet x the level of the spell and dim light to double that range until the beginning of your next turn. Hostile creatures inside the bright light have disadvantage on Perception checks based on sight and when they take radiant damage, it is increased by an amount equal to half your proficiency modifier.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",
