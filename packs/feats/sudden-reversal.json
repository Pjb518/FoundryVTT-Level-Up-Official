If you do so, until the start of your next turn you can spend 1 exertion point to make one attack with an unarmed strike or improvised weapon or perform one basic maneuver each time a creature hits you with an attack. You can use your special exertion pool from the Pugilist feat to do so.</p>\n<p>In addition, when you critically hit with an unarmed strike or improvised weapon attack while raging, you deal additional damage equal to a roll of your martial arts die. This is added to the extra damage dealt by the critical hit and is not multiplied as part of the critical hit.</p>",
