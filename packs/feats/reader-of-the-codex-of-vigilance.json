You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You gain proficiency with Perception and Insight if you are not already proficient and an expertise die if you are. Your maximum expertise die size for both skills is a d10.</li>\n<li>Your senses are as much things of magic as they are part of your body. You are immune to the blinded and deafened conditions.</li>\n<li>You gain the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.uu1u44qe27ws6if7]{Eyes of the Rune Keeper} invocation if you do not already have it and another of your choice that you qualify for if you do.</li>\n<li>As long as you are not grappled, incapacitated, stunned, or suffering from 4 or more levels of fatigue, enemies gain no bonus for flanking you.</li>\n<li>All of your wielder levels count as warlock levels for the purpose of qualifying for the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.vynv0u2msag0ix0m]{Witch Sight} invocation.</li>\n<li>You never trigger direct harm to yourself by reading. You cannot take psychic damage or gain levels of strife from the contents of text, magical or otherwise, you do not set off glyphs of warding by reading them, etc. The full effects of this benefit are up to the Narrator, who is encouraged to interpret them broadly and generously.</li>\n</ul>",
