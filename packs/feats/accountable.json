You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your Strength or wielder spellcasting ability score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>\n<li>Your wielder levels count as herald levels for the purpose of determining the size of your @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.my42mip0qc35rcp2]{Lay on Hands} pool.</li>\n<li>Your artifact takes on some of your devotion to your ideals. When you gain inspiration from your destiny while wielding your artifact, it surges with power. You choose one of the following additional effects. If you fulfill your destiny while wielding your artifact, you may choose as many of them as you desire. Each effect only activates once.\n<ul>\n<li>If you are bloodied, you are healed to the minimum number of hit points where you would no longer be bloodied.</li>\n<li>You can remove a level of fatigue or strife you are suffering from.</li>\n<li>A friendly creature that witnesses your deed immediately recovers a level of fatigue or strife.</li>\n<li>Every creature within 30 feet of you that is suffering from a non-magical disease is instantly cured.</li>\n<li>You gain the effects of the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.h5ssew7apf5ofbhc]{Commune}, @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.pdwrag8eq7r0ldcp]{Commune with Nature}, or @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.59she20yqbp2giqq]{Contact Other Plane} spell (your choice) at a time of your choosing before your next long rest.</li>\n<li>All friendly creatures within 100 feet of you that are currently making death saves are healed for a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your wielder spellcasting ability modifier.</li>\n<li>Hostile creatures of a CR equal to half your character level or less that can see you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your wielder spell save DC or be stunned until the end of their next turn. At the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion, creatures that would be stunned this way can opt to become indifferent to you and leave or become friendly to you and join your side instead of being stunned.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",
