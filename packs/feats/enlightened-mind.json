You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain a +1 bonus to your choice of your Intelligence or Dexterity score, to a maximum value of 20.</li><li>You gain proficiency with two additional skills, one each from the Adept and Scholar class lists. You may always choose to use intelligence on checks made with the chosen two skills.</li><li>You may spend an exertion point whenever you make a skill check using intelligence to gain an expertise die on the check, and if you roll a natural 1 on such a check you may spend 2 exertion to re-roll it.</li></ul>",
