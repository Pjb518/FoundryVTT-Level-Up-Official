Shadows cling to you and you can strike with precision using the most fearsome weapons. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>\n<li>Heavy armor no longer imposes a stealth penalty on you.</li>\n<li>When you move from an area of dim light or darkness into an area of bright light on your turn, you are lightly obscured while in the light. This obscurement lasts until the beginning of your next turn or until you re-enter an area of dim light or darkness, whichever comes first.</li>\n<li>You can use any melee weapon with @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.4727pnvz5nwn3h23]{Sneak Attack}.</li>\n<li>When you would deal sneak attack damage, you can choose to reduce the bonus damage by a number of six-sided dice up to half the number of sneak attack dice you have. If you do, you can apply this reserved damage to the next attack you hit with this turn. If the damage is not used by the end of your turn, it is lost.</li>\n</ul>",
