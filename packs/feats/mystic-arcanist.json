You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Your Wisdom or Charisma score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li><li>When you cast a spell that restores hit points, you restore an additional number of hit points equal to your Charisma modifier.</li><li>You can spend sorcery points to temporarily gain a spell from the cleric or sorcerer spell lists. Temporarily gaining a spell in this way costs a number of sorcery points equal to the spell&rsquo;s level. You cannot gain a spell in this way that has a level higher than your highest level spell slot. When you gain a cleric spell in this way, it is considered prepared for the day. When you gain a sorcerer spell in this way, it is considered a spell you know for the day. You lose all spells gained in this way whenever you finish a long rest .</li></ul>",
