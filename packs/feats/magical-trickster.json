You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You learn the mage hand cantrip if you do not already know it (if you do, you learn another wizard cantrip of your choosing in its place. The new cantrip does not count against your maximum cantrips known.</p></li><li><p>When cast by you, mage hand creates a pair of hands instead of one. The hands also have Strength and Dexterity scores equal to your Intelligence score. You may use the mage hands to do anything your normal hands could do, but you must spend actions as normal to do so. If the hands are out of view, you must have some means of seeing what they are doing in order to use them (the arcane eye spell is a popular means of doing so for mages who can cast it). You may make attacks and even cast spells with the hands, but doing so expends your action as normal.</p></li><li><p>You may have the bonus damage from your Sneak Attack deal the same type of damage as a cantrip you know would deal. Once you have used this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p></li></ul>",
