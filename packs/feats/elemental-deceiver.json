A creature in the cube must hold its breath or begin suffocating. This also extinguishes any open flames.<br><br>These changes have no fixed duration, but mixing the denatured element with unaffected elements of its type dissipates the denatured element harmlessly. For example, a 5-foot section of a larger fire will slowly return to heat as the surrounding fire warms it (though if the entire fire is contained in the cube, it will not), barren sand can be harmlessly mixed into fertile soil, and air and water currents will harmlessly dissipate denatured elements of their type. Left unattended, a denatured area is absorbed by the surrounding environment and vanishes after 1d4 hours unless sealed in a container or otherwise prevented from co-mingling with the normal element of its type.</li></ul>",
