You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>After you take the Attack action, you can immediately use @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.my42mip0qc35rcp2]{Lay on Hands} as a bonus action.</li>\n<li>Half your fighter levels count as herald levels for the purpose of the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.xezwxikwrsfkzg4o]{Sacred Aura} and @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.eg3jukesb09wd7ot]{Improved Sacred Aura} features.</li>\n<li>Half your herald levels count as fighter levels for the purpose of the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.7vvqy990w8pxatdy]{Indomitable} feature.</li>\n<li>If a spell or effect would impose a condition you are immune to on you, you can spend a use of Indomitable as a reaction to attempt a save against it anyway. If the save fails, nothing happens. If it succeeds, the effect is reflected back on its source, which suffers the full effects of being targeted by the effect or if it does not target an individual creature, being in its area. You still suffer any effects that you are not immune to, and all other targets are affected as normal.</li>\n</ul>",
