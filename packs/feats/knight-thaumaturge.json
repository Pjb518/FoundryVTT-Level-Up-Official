		"description": "<p>You have cooked up magically-martial tricks that most people have never seen and are probably a legendary figure for the devastation you bring. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your Strength, Dexterity, or Intelligence score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>\n<li>When you reduce a creature with a CR of at least half your character level to 0 hit points with a weapon attack, you recover a first-level spell slot if you have any used. If all of your first-level spell slots are unused, you gain temporary hit points equal to twice your proficiency bonus instead.</li>\n<li>As an action, you can infuse a thrown item like an @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-adventuring-gear.Item.b0z0yz39b3qy3hdo]{Acid Flask}, @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-adventuring-gear.Item.sh0462lz1jwwm4rm]{Vial of Holy Water}, or @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-adventuring-gear.Item.ukcav3i8dudpalir]{Tanglefoot Bag} with a spell and throw it at a target. If you hit, the target is affected by the item normally and the spell is cast on the target or the target&rsquo;s space as applicable. If the spell would normally have multiple targets, it only affects the target of the thrown item.</li>\n<li>As long as you have unused spell slots, every weapon you wield gains the Breaker property and counts as magical.</li>\n</ul>",
