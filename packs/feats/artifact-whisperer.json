If the infusion provides such a bonus in addition to other effects, use the higher of the two values by the infusion and your Bonded Artifact. The infusion&rsquo;s effects are otherwise cumulative with those of the Bonded Artifact itself if possible. If the effects are contradictory with those of the Bonded Artifact in some way, you may switch between the capabilities of your Bonded Artifact and the infusion or vice versa as a bonus action. If the infusion would normally require attunement, that requirement is waived when it is applied to your Bonded Artifact.</li></ul>",
