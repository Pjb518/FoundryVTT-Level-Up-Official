The number of psi dice you may spend on augments for a given casting cannot exceed the level of the spell slot expended.</li><li>You may expend a psi die when casting a spell of 1st-level or higher with a cast time of one action, bonus action, or reaction. &nbsp;When doing so, you may ignore any vocalized, seen, or material components of the casting except those material components with a non-trivial gold value. &nbsp;Such a psi die is rolled and lost or regained if it were used for an augment.</li><li>You gain the Book of Dreams ritual mastery option if you do not already have it. &nbsp;If you do, you gain a different ritual mastery option. &nbsp;If you gain it from this feat, it comes with a number of rituals in it equal to your witch level + your esper level - 7. If you already had it and it has fewer rituals in it than that, you may immediately add rituals up to that number, and may add a new one anytime you gain a level of witch or esper.</li></ul>",
