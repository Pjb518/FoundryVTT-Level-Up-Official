You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.ulmcmf3ofmpzmgzf]{Eldritch Blast} can deal the damage type dealt by your Sanguine Transferrence ability rather than force damage if you desire.</li>\n<li>Half your warlock levels count as bloodblade levels for the purpose of the Unnatural Mien feature.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>While you are in blood frenzy, your warlock spells cost 1 less spell point to cast.</li>\n<li>Your patron allows you a way out of your blood frenzy, but it takes a toll. If you would attack a creature that is friendly to you while in blood frenzy, you can invoke your patron&rsquo;s aid (no action required). Your frenzy ends immediately and you suffer a random short-term mental stress effect. You cannot use this benefit if you have a number of short-term mental stress effects equal to or greater than your proficiency bonus. When you finish a long rest in a haven, you remove one mental stress effect gained this way.</li>\n</ul>",
