You now are proficient in death saving throws, and if you die, if your soul vessel is intact, you return to life 2d6 weeks after your death.</li>\n<li>Your soul vessel itself also becomes more durable. Its AC increases to 18, its hit points increase to 60, and it now has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Improved Forbidden Knowledge. </em></strong>You learn a new 4th-level spell, 5th-level spell, and 6th-level spell. The spells must be ones from the <em>necromancy</em>, <em>affliction</em>, <em>knowledge</em>, <em>necrotic</em>, <em>psychic</em>, or <em>scrying </em>schools.&nbsp;These spells do not count against the spells you know or can have prepared, and they always count as being prepared. These spells are added to your class's spell list for you; if you have more than one spellcasting class, you choose which list to add them to.</li>\n</ul>",
