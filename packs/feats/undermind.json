You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your Dexterity or Intelligence score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>\n<li>Half your rogue levels count as esper levels for the purpose of the Id Insinuation feature.</li>\n<li>If you would score a critical hit while using @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.4727pnvz5nwn3h23]{Sneak Attack}, you can instead choose to deal no damage (including base weapon damage) and immediately force the target to take a single action or bonus action it would normally have available to it on its turn. You choose any targets or parameters for the action, after which the creature regains control of itself.</li>\n<li>While you are psionically-focused, you can choose to become invisible. You can remain invisible this way for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus, but they need not be contiguous. This benefit resets when you finish a long rest.</li>\n</ul>",
