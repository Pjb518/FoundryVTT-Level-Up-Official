    "description": "<p>Your wrath bursts the dams of even your connection with nature, outpouring from you and your stampede like a plague of fury.</p><p>While raging, you and any creatures benefiting from your Living Stampede emit 5-foot auras of fury. When a creature other than you or your allies enters a fury aura or starts its turn there it makes a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature becomes confused, except instead of rolling to determine their actions as normal for the confused condition, they are always considered to have rolled the 7 or 8 result. At the end of each of a confused creature’s turns it repeats the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once a creature successfully saves against this effect, it is immune to it for the remainder of your rage.</p>",
