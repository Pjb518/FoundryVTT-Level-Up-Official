You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain a magical mystery and Eldritch Invocation of your choice.</li><li>Anytime you would gain a magical mystery you may gain an eldritch invocation or secret of arcana, and if you would gain an eldritch invocation you may gain a magical mystery instead. &nbsp;You may add half your witch levels to your warlock level for the purpose of qualifying for eldritch invocations or secrets of arcana and half your warlock level to your witch levels for the purpose of magical mysteries. &nbsp;If you take the sixth, seventh, eighth, or penultimate arcanum invocations and your warlock level is not high enough to qualify on its own, you must choose a spell that is on both the witch and warlock spell lists.</li></ul>",
