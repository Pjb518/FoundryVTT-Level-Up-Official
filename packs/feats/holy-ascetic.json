You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your Dexterity or Wisdom score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>\n<li>When you cast a cleric spell, your speed increases by (the spell level + 1) x 10 feet until the end of the turn. Multiple instances of this benefit stack with each other. Cantrips are considered level 0 spells for the purposes of this feature.</li>\n<li>You no longer age, and your age cannot be changed with magic. In addition, you are immune to any effect that would alter your form such as @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.95tar7xr3hdp0o92]{Polymorph} and you cannot be infected with vampirism, lycanthropy, or other similar afflictions unless you decide to allow it.</li>\n<li>As long as you have a spell slot available, you do not need food, water, sleep, or air to survive. You must still take rests and consume supply in order to recover hit points and class-based resources like channel divinity, exertion, and spell slots.</li>\n</ul>",
