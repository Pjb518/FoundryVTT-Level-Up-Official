Though you may like to think of yourself as above superstition, you cannot doubt the efficacy of such practices, and in the blackest darkness even you will seek the aid of faith, gaining the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain access to the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.zhuf06durl8bnmh3]{Turn Undead} ability of a cleric. Use your combined Ranger and Scholar levels as your effective cleric level to determine how many times you can use it per short rest. &nbsp;Your DC for this ability is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier. &nbsp;By expending a hit die when doing so, you may apply an @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.zezsezm2e0azb3ty]{Empowered Turning} effect along with it, and when doing so with @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.1il31a6es33x2grt]{Turn Supernatural} you may also select aberrations as the creature type. &nbsp;If you expend a hit die and inspiration, you may instead apply two empowered turning effects.</li><li>You may also expend a hit die to replicate the effects of a @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.wa2nd43b9dvkh1yu]{Protection from Evil and Good} spell as well as the <em>backcountry elder sign</em> rare spell. &nbsp;Similar to scholar abilities, this does not count as actually casting a spell. &nbsp;If you have the Hedge Mage or Wildborn archetype, you know and may also cast this spell using spell slots if you have slots of a high enough level, treating it as a Ranger and/or Scholar spell.</li></ul>",
