You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Your Wisdom score increases by +1, to a maximum of 20.</li><li>You ignore the speed penalty from all forms of difficult terrain. If there is an additional effect such as damage or requiring a save to avoid falling prone, it affects you as normal.</li><li>When you acquire this feat, choose a creature type from the following list: <em>Aberrations</em>, <em>Celestials</em>, <em>Fey</em>, <em>Fiends</em>, or <em>Undead</em>. The chosen creature type always counts as your studied adversary in addition to your normal choice.</li><li>When you cast a cleric spell, if you have no spell slots remaining, you immediately gain 4 points of exertion and 2 uses of Trained Accuracy. Once you have used this benefit, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a long rest.</li></ul>",
