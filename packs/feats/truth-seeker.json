Fortunately, you have begun to acquire that training.&nbsp;You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>When you choose your sets of enemy types for your @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.01szspr1nunp0lql]{Divine Sense}, pick twice rather than once.</p></li><li><p>When you use your Divine Sense, it can identify the presence of creatures with the shapechanger type within its range, regardless of what enemy types you have chosen.</p></li><li><p>All spells of the knowledge school are herald spells for you.</p></li><li><p>As a Truth Seeker, you have access to libraries of your order and allied organizations, many of which are off-limits to most. With enough time spent in a library, you can uncover most of the answers you seek (any question answerable with a DC 20 Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion check).</p><p>If you already have a similar feature (such as from the Sage background) you instead increase the DC of questions you can answer with research by 5.</p></li><li><p>Your @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.4727pnvz5nwn3h23]{Sneak Attack} dice increase to d8s against creatures of the types you chose for your Divine Sense, as well as against shapechangers.</p></li></ul>",
