		"description": "<p>You have learned to tame the wolf within and gained some control over the curse of lycanthropy. On full moon nights you involuntarily change into a wolf or wolf-humanoid hybrid. While you are transformed, you gain the following features.</p><p><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You canâ€™t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.</p><p><strong><em>Fang and Claw.</em></strong> You gain a bite natural weapon and claw natural weapons which you are proficient with. You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack rolls of your bite or claw. On a hit your bite or claw deals piercing damage equal to 1d6 plus your Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier (whichever is highest).</p><p><strong><em>Keen Hearing and Smell.</em></strong> You have advantage on Perception checks that rely on hearing or smell.</p>",
