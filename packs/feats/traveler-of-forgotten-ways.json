		"description": "<p>Your ancient magic takes you to places where few seek to tread. Your wilderness training lets you walk there unafraid. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Half your ranger levels count as witch levels for the purpose of the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.f3gqgjl29sdwvt7i]{A Blessing or a Curse} feature and gain an additional benefit based on the option you choose:\n<ul>\n<li>If you choose @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.8icd91l5z34orf66]{Witch's Blessing}, you can spend a use when making a weapon attack. If you do, the bonus damage done by your @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.yuncbhlz6js1w4t4]{Hunter's Target} feature increases to 1d12, is radiant damage and on a successful hit outlines the target in a faerie fire effect until the end of its next turn.</li>\n<li>If you choose @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.5xuo47w64m4cow6c]{Witch's Curse}, you can spend a use when making a weapon attack. If you do, the bonus damage done by your Hunter&rsquo;s Target feature increases to 1d12, is necrotic damage and the target cannot recover hit points until the end of its next turn.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You can rely upon your magic to help you track targets. If you fail on a Survival check while tracking, you can spend a first-level or higher spell slot to immediately roll a d8 and add it to the results of the check, potentially turning a failure into a success.</li>\n<li>When you perform a journey activity from the following list, pick a second as well: Gather Components, Harvest, Hunt and Gather. You perform both activities simultaneously, but roll for them separately, even if they use the same skill.</li>\n<li>When you would select an @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.oob7093n1ddzwm8f]{Exploration Knack} or @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.vmkfr5u0neendp2v]{Magical Mystery}, you may choose from either list, but must meet any prerequisites.</li>\n</ul>",
