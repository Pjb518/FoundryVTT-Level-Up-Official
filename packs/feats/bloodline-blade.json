		"description": "<p>You have learned to incorporate your inborn magical abilities and your combat training in surprising ways. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you score a critical hit against a creature with a CR equal to at least half your character level, you recover a sorcery point.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Half your fighter levels count as sorcerer levels for the purpose of the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.huephhrybue9iiws]{Arcane Refinement} feature.</li>\n<li>Half your sorcerer levels count as fighter levels for the purpose of the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.akcpgwxdtkzp0290]{Martial Lore (Fighter)} feature.</li>\n<li>Choose one of the following @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.h2tobazibq72ybdo]{Manifestations}. It does not count against your manifestations known.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Crushing Impact (bludgeoning)</h3>\n<p>When you cast a spell or make a weapon attack that deals bludgeoning damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point and choose one creature you can see. If that creature takes bludgeoning damage from the spell or attack, it must make a Strength save against your spell save DC or be moved 10 feet in a direction of your choosing (&ldquo;up&rdquo; is a valid choice, at which point the target falls normally unless it has a fly speed), knocked prone, and rattled until the end of its next turn. A creature that succeeds on its save is still rattled, but is not moved or knocked prone.</p>\n<h3>Bloodletting Slash (slashing)</h3>\n<p>When you cast a spell or make a weapon attack that deals slashing damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point and choose one creature you can see. If that creature takes slashing damage from the spell or attack, it takes 1d4 ongoing damage for the next minute or until a creature uses an action to stanch the bleeding.</p>\n<h3>Agonizing Puncture (piercing)</h3>\n<p>When you cast a spell or make a weapon attack that deals piercing damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point and choose one creature you can see. If that creature takes piercing damage from the spell or attack, it must make a Constitution save against your spell save DC or be poisoned for the next minute. An affected creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p>",
