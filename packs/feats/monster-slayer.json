		"description": "<p>Many scholars have, in the course of their studies, uncovered far more knowledge of the terrifying monsters that haunt this world than any ordinary person would care to know. Many monster hunters are keenly aware that when battling true horrors, knowledge is a more valuable weapon than mere blades. &nbsp;Monster slayers understand these truths and dedicate themselves to arming themselves well with this weapon to eradicate monsters wherever they threaten the innocent. &nbsp;You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain a +1 bonus to your choice of your Intelligence or Wisdom score, to a maximum value of 20.</li><li>You gain an additional @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.t7ujv9cc4us40fj9]{Studied Adversary}, which is always active. &nbsp;This additional adversary must be of the following types: aberrations, celestials, fey, fiends, or undead. You also gain an additional number of uses of @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.8qhg7efkuie3fwh2]{Accuracy Bonus} equal to your intelligence modifier. &nbsp;These bonus uses may only be used against a studied adversary. &nbsp;</li><li>You gain your choice of @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.v4pkjilh484jph6i]{Precision Strikes} or @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.okthtwyohmh0eoa5]{Mystic Apprentice} scholar abilities. &nbsp;If you choose Precision Strikes, you may make an Nature, History, Arcana, or Religion check using intelligence (the specific skill used must be one that could be used to recall knowledge about the creature in question) with a DC of 10+the CR of the creature when targeting a favored adversary and, if successful, the benefits last for 1 minute rather than until the end of your next turn. &nbsp;If you choose Mystic Apprentice, you gain @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.7mwrwjjj3mn4yzxr]{Altered Strike} as a bonus cantrip, in addition to the other two you would normally gain.</li></ul>",
