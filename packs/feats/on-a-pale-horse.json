You may cast it once per short or long rest without expending spell points or a spell slot, and you cast it at 5th level when doing so. &nbsp;Its type is undead rather than fey, fiend, or celestial, it is resistant to necrotic damage and damage from non-magical weapons, and while riding it you gain resistance to necrotic damage or immunity if you are already resistant. &nbsp;If your steed makes an attack roll, it uses your spell attack bonus in place of it's normal attack bonus, and if it hits with an attack while you are mounted on it you may have it deliver a Divine Smite just as if you had delivered it yourself using your Divine Smite feature (expending one of your uses). If you are able to empower your smites, you may choose to empower it as normal. &nbsp;Your steed is immune to Turn Undead so long as you are riding it.</li><li>You may expend points from your Lay on Hands pool up to your proficiency bonus and touch your steed, and when doing so your steed gains temporary hit points equal to the number of points expended x your herald+warlock level. &nbsp;Once you have done so, you may not do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</li></ul>",
