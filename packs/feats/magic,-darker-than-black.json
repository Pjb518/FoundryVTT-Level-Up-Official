You gain the following abilities:</p><ul><li>Whenever you cast a spell of 1st-level through 5th-level from any of the sub schools listed under Black Magic, treat it as if it were one level higher than you cast it at. This stacks with any bonus gained from Blood Magic on Evil spells.</li><li>You may cast the <em>summon fiend</em> spell at 4th-level once per long rest without spending a spell slot or spell points. &nbsp;If your warlock level is 7 or higher you also treat it as a warlock spell known that does not count against your spells known, and if your witch level is 7 or higher you treat it as a witch spell that is always prepared and does not count against your prepared spells.</li></ul>",
