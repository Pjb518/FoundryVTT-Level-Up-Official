While you are chanting, you have advantage on concentration checks, and you also create a protective magical field around yourself. You count as lightly obscured to hostile creatures, and you may use your reaction to blast a creature that deals damage to you. The creature must make a Dexterity save against your spell save DC. A creature that fails its save takes 3d6 radiant or necrotic damage (choose when you use this ability) and is <em>Rattled </em>for one minute. A creature that succeeds on its save takes half damage and is not <em>Rattled</em>.</p></li><li><p>When you hit a creature with your Eldritch Blast or when a creature fails its saving throw against it, select another creature you can see. Until the end of your next turn, it either suffers a -<strong>1d4 penalty </strong>to all attack rolls and saving throws or it gains a <strong>1d4 bonus </strong>to all attack rolls and saving throws.</p></li></ul>",
