You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Your Wisdom score or your Intelligence score increases by +1, to a maximum of 20.</li><li>Your <em>Esper</em> levels count as cleric levels for the purpose of acquiring and using the <em>Providence</em> feature.</li><li>You may spend any number of dice from your <em>Psychic Reservoir</em> as if you had rolled a 1 on them to regain <em>Cleric</em> spell slots with total levels equal to the dice spent. For example, if you spent 3 psionic dice this way, you could recover a third level spell slot, three first level spell slots, or a second level spell slot and a first level spell slot. You cannot exceed your normal number of spell slots available at once for a level this way, and once you have used this benefit, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a long rest.</li><li>While your <em>Psychic Focus</em> is active you gain an additional benefit based on your discipline:<ul><li><strong>Empathic</strong>: You have advantage on saves to disbelieve illusions.</li><li><strong>Kinesthetic</strong>: Your speed increases by 10 feet.</li><li><strong>Telepathic</strong>: Creatures attempting to read your mind must save against your spell save DC or take 2d8 radiant or necrotic damage (selected when you take this feat).</li><li><strong>Telekinetic</strong>: You may wield a spellcasting focus without needing a hand free.</li></ul></li></ul>",
