Your attack scores a critical hit on a roll of 19–20. If you already have a feature that increases the range of your critical hits, your critical hit range for that attack is increased by 1 (maximum 17–20).</p></li><li><p>When a creature is damaged by an attack that was aided by the use of your Help action, you don’t provoke opportunity attacks from that creature until the end of your next turn.</p></li></ul>",
