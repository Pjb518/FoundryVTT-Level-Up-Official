Your expertise die in Stealth can be upgraded from a d8 to a d10 or from a d10 to a d12 in this way.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You acquire an additional Stealth skill specialty of your choice.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You may switch weapons without spending an action as long as both weapons are ranged or lack the two-handed property.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You leave virtually no trace of your passage. Attempts to detect your presence in an area you have visited with Investigation or Perception checks are made at disadvantage, as are attempts to track you with Survival.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you apply @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.yuncbhlz6js1w4t4]{Hunter's Target} you become invisible until the beginning of your next turn.
