You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>When your rage ends, you regain a number of spent hit points in your Lay on Hands pool equal to your proficiency bonus. (Any excess beyond your pool maximum is lost.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you are blinded or deafened, you may still use your Danger Sense, but must spend a use of your Divine Sense to do so.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you convert a spell slot into exertion points, if you have one or more uses of Rage remaining, you are healed for a number of hit points equal to the level of the converted spell slot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>While you are raging, your melee weapon attacks deal an additional 1d8 radiant damage.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
