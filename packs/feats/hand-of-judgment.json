(Any excess beyond your pool maximum is lost.)</p></li><li><p>If you are blinded or deafened, you may still use your Danger Sense, but must spend a use of your Divine Sense to do so.</p></li><li><p>When you convert a spell slot into exertion points, if you have one or more uses of Rage remaining, you are healed for a number of hit points equal to the level of the converted spell slot.</p></li><li><p>While you are raging, your melee weapon attacks deal an additional 1d8 radiant damage.</p></li></ul>",
