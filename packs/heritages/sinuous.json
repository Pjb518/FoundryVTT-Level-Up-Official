		"description": "<h2>Sinuous Traits</h2>\n<p>Characters with the sinuous heritage share a variety of traits in common with one another.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Sinuous mature at about the same rate as a human, reaching adulthood around age 20. Their supernatural essence makes them extraordinarily long-lived, however, with most living well into their 800s and a few living to more than a thousand years old.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Sinuous have human-sized torsos on long, serpentine bodies that stretch 20 feet long or more. They usually weigh at least 350 pounds and sometimes as many as 600. They can coil themselves up to not occupy much more space than a human, however. Your size is large, but you use medium-sized equipment and can comfortably move through most spaces designed for medium-sized creatures.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Serpentine Physiology.</strong></em> Your lower body has the shape of a massive, powerful snake. This grants you the following advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are immune to the Prone condition while in contact with the ground. If you are knocked prone while flying, you fall as normal.</li>\n<li>You can scale a tree, pillar, or other vertical structure of roughly cylindrical shape as long as it is no more than 5 feet in diameter or less than 1 by coiling around it and slithering your way up. You have a climb speed equal to half your walking speed while doing this, and your hands remain free while you do so.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Magical Sense.</strong></em> You know the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.kaye34nheyrit487]{Detect Magic} spell and can always cast it as a ritual.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Supernatural Origin.</strong></em> You know a cantrip from the following list: @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.mocigztrqyoks506]{Mage Hand}, @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.uy8he1yquaiym6y8]{Prestidigitation}, @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.omvngnmoo75is54f]{Spare the Dying}, or @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.eiek2vbzwijd0qac]{Thaumaturgy}. Your spellcasting ability score for this cantrip is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (whichever is highest).</p>\n<h2>Sinuous Gifts</h2>\n<p>Sinuous are highly-varied and diverse even within the same family tree. In addition to the traits found in your sinuous heritage, select one of the following sinuous gifts.</p>\n<h3>Constrictor</h3>\n<p>Some sinuous have exceptionally muscular tails and heavy, armored scales. They tend to also have muscular torsos and scales on their upper bodies. You have the following traits:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Scales.</strong></em> You have tough, plate-like scales. While you aren&rsquo;t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Constrict.</strong></em> You gain an expertise die on checks to initiate or maintain a grapple on creatures of Medium size or smaller, which can be coiled around as part of the grapple. Once per turn as a bonus action, you can squeeze a grappled creature in your coils, dealing bludgeoning damage equal to 2d4 + your Strength modifier. In addition, your hands remain free when you are grappling another creature. You cannot use your climb speed from Sinuous Physiology while using this trait. You cannot coil around creatures of Large or larger size.</p>\n<h3>Viper</h3>\n<p>Some sinuous have dagger-like fangs and venom sacs. These sinuous are likely to have viper-like physical traits such as a cobra&rsquo;s hood or a rattle on the end of their tail. You have the following traits:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Venomous Bite.</strong></em> You have a venomous bite. As an action, you can attack with your bite (which is considered a finesse weapon) dealing piercing damage equal to 1d4 + ability modifier and poison damage equal to 1d4 + your proficiency bonus. Rapid Bite. You can also bite much faster, forgoing the opportunity to inject venom. You may make a bite attack as a bonus action, dealing 1d4 points of piercing damage + your ability modifier (but no poison).</p>\n<p><em><strong>Poison Resistance.</strong></em> You are resistant to poison damage and have advantage on saves to avoid the poisoned condition.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Menacing Viper.</strong></em> You gain proficiency with the Intimidation skill.</p>\n<h3>Winged Serpent</h3>\n<p>Some sinuous take strongly after their couatl progenitors and grow feathered wings. These sinuous are more likely than most to have colorful scales and feathers on other parts of their bodies such as a feathered crest on their heads or shoulders. You have the following trait:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Flight.</strong></em> You have a fly speed of 30 feet. To use this speed, you can&rsquo;t be wearing medium or heavy armor. Whenever you spend 3 full consecutive rounds airborne without landing, you gain a level of fatigue. Any fatigue gained in this way is removed upon finishing a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2>Sinuous Paragon</h2>\n<p>With enough time and training any sinuous can unlock their full serpentine potential. When you reach 10th level, you select one of the following paragon gifts.</p>\n<h3>Crushing Constrictor</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Constrictor heritage gift</em></p>\n<p>The damage dealt by your squeeze increases to 2d8 + your Strength modifier. In addition, if a creature you have in your coils is bloodied, it cannot breathe and must hold its breath or begin suffocating.</p>\n<h3>Terrible Venom</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Viper heritage gift</em></p>\n<p>Your venom has become some truly nasty stuff. The poison damage of your venomous bite attack increases to 1d8+ your proficiency bonus and a creature taking this damage must make a Constitution save against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier or be poisoned until the end of its next turn.</p>\n<h3>Spit Venom</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Viper heritage gift</em></p>\n<p>You gain the ability to spit blinding venom at your foes. Your venom spit is a ranged weapon attack with a range of 40 feet. If you hit, the target suffers 2d6 points of poison damage and must make a Constitution save against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier or be blinded for until the end of its next turn.</p>\n<h3>Consecrated Venom</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Viper heritage gift</em></p>\n<p>Your venom has become infused with holy power. Your venomous bite attack now deals an additional 1d4 points of radiant damage on a hit, which increases to 1d8 against aberrations, fiends, and undead. In addition, you learn the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.l0xg2yboy5z633pr]{Venomous Succor} spell and can cast it once per long rest without using a spell slot.</p>\n<h3>Serpentine Versatility</h3>\n<p>You select a second Sinuous Gift, gaining its benefits as normal.</p>\n<h3>Powerful Wings</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Winged Serpent heritage gift</em></p>\n<p>Your fly speed increases to 40 feet and you can fly while wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>\n<p>When you would suffer fatigue from using your fly speed, you make a Constitution saving throw (DC 10 + 1 per previous save in the last minute). On a success, you do not suffer fatigue from flying that round.</p>",
