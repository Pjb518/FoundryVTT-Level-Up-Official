		"description": "<h2>Corvin Traits</h2>\n<p>Characters with the corvin heritage share a variety of traits in common with one another.</p>\n<p><strong>Age.</strong> Corvins mature and age at a similar rate to humans.</p>\n<p><strong>Size.</strong> Corvins rarely exceed 4 feet tall and weigh less than 100 pounds. Your size is Small.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Fearless.</strong> Your boldness knows no bounds. You are immune to the frightened condition.</p>\n<p><strong>Master Mimic.</strong> You gain proficiency in Deception and an expertise die to checks made to mimic sounds and the voices of others.</p>\n<h2>Corvin Gifts</h2>\n<p>In addition to the traits found in your corvin heritage, choose one of the following gifts.</p>\n<h3>Blessing of Friendship</h3>\n<p>The bonds you share with your allies is so strong it manifests as aid. Once per short or long rest you may gift a small, shiny trinket (such as button or coin) to an ally, imbuing it with a minor blessing. In the next 8 hours, if that ally fails an ability check they may immediately expend the blessing, adding 1d4 to the roll. After the blessing has been used, the gifted trinket reverts to a mundane object unless you use this ability again to re-bless it.</p>\n<h3>Ill Omen</h3>\n<p>To some, your crow-like form is a harbinger of bad things to come, and they don&rsquo;t realize how right they are. As a bonus action, you mutter a curse against an enemy creature that you can see within 60 feet. Choose one ability score. That creature has disadvantage on saving throws using that ability until the start of your next turn. Spells such as remove curse immediately end this effect. Once you have used this ability, &nbsp;you may not do so again until you complete a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Preternatural Communicator</h3>\n<p>You are gifted with supernatural abilities to communicate with those around you&mdash;for good or in the name of mischief. You learn the message cantrip. At 3rd level, choose either comprehend languages or missage. At 5th level, choose either babel tongue or sending. These do not count towards the spells you know, and you may cast them once per day without expending any spell slots. Your spellcasting ability modifier for these spells is either Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, whichever is highest.</p>\n<h2>Corvin Paragon</h2>\n<p>When you reach 10th level, you become a better corvin and gain one paragon gift from the following list.</p>\n<h3>Carrion Crow</h3>\n<p>Necrotic energy flows through you, turning you into an omen of death. Once per long rest, you may cast the spell vampiric touch as if you had cast it at 4th level. When you cast this spell against a creature with the undead creature type, you ignore resistance to necrotic damage. If the undead creature has immunity to necrotic damage, treat it as resistance instead.</p>\n<h3>Third Eye</h3>\n<p>You leverage your latent divine connection to consult with a higher power and gain knowledge or portents of the future. You learn the spell divination and may always cast it as a ritual. This does not count towards the number of spells you know, and you may cast it without material components.</p>\n<h3>Thought and Memory</h3>\n<p>You can connect with those around you on a more esoteric level. You gain telepathy out to a range of 60 feet. Additionally, you may choose to allow creatures that you are communicating with telepathically to read your surface thoughts, as in the spell detect thoughts. If an enemy creature attempts to read your mind or magically control you (such as the spell dominate person), you have advantage on your saving throw.</p>",
