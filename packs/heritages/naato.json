You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>\n<h2>Naato Gifts</h2>\n<p>In addition to the traits found in your naato heritage, select one of the following gifts.</p>\n<h3>Amphibious</h3>\n<p>You can breathe normally in both air and water and you have a swim speed of 30 feet.</p>\n<h3>Camouflage</h3>\n<p>While all naato have some ability to alter their coloring, you can use a bonus action to change the color of your scales to match your surroundings for a period of up to one minute. You gain advantage on Stealth checks. Once you have used this feature you cannot use it again until you have taken a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Spiky</h3>\n<p>When a creature grabs you it takes 1d6 piercing damage. Each turn it maintains the grab, it takes this damage again.</p>\n<h3>Tail Swipe</h3>\n<p>Your tail is edged with spikes, making it a potent weapon. You can use a bonus action to make an attack with your tail with a reach of 5 feet, and which counts as a natural weapon and does piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier. Alternatively, if you use it to trip your target with the knockdown basic maneuver, the target makes their saving throw at disadvantage.</p>\n<h2>Naato Paragon</h2>\n<p>Upon reaching 10th level, you become a personification of the ideals of your people. You gain the following paragon gift.</p>\n<h3>Perfect Camouflage</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Camouflage</em></p>\n<p>Your camouflage ability becomes more pronounced, enabling you to blend in perfectly with the environment. You can use a bonus action to become invisible. You remain invisible for as long as you continue to use your bonus actions to maintain your camouflage. If you take damage, you must make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC equal to 10 + the amount of damage, or your camouflage ends. Once you have used this feature you cannot use it again until you take a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Poison Breath</h3>\n<p>You are able to exhale poisonous fumes in a 15-foot cone in front of you. As an action, you exhale poisonous fumes, and all creatures (except yourself and other naato) in the area must make a Constitution saving throw or take poison damage equal to 3d8 + your Constitution modifier. The DC of this saving throw is 8+ your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, after which you must take a long rest before using it again.</p>",
