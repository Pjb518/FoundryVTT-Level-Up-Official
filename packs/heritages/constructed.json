		"description": "<h2>Constructed Traits</h2>\n<p>Characters with constructed heritage share&nbsp;a variety of traits in common.</p>\n<p><strong>Age. </strong>Constructed do not age, many&nbsp;beginning life fully physically mature. With&nbsp;proper maintenance they can be immortal.</p>\n<p><strong>Size. </strong>Constructed are engineered from metal, hardwood, and other dense (often&nbsp;expensive) materials that make them&nbsp;heavy, most weighing between 175 and&nbsp;400 pounds and standing anywhere from&nbsp;3 to 7 feet tall. Your size is Small or&nbsp;Medium.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed. </strong>Your Speed is 25 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Constructed Nature. </strong>You are resistant to poison damage and gain one of the following benefits.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You don't require air.</li>\n<li>You gain an expertise die on saving throws made to avoid being charmed or frightened.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Mechanical Metabolism. </strong>Certain types of healing are less effective or even wholly ineffective. Sources of nonmagical healing&nbsp;other than taking a rest have no effect.&nbsp;Magical healing only restores half as&nbsp;many hit points as normal unless you are&nbsp;also repaired in the same round (with an&nbsp;Engineering check, the mending cantrip,&nbsp;or similar).</p>\n<p>In addition, you don&rsquo;t require Supply&nbsp;in the typical sense; instead of eating&nbsp;food, you rely on a specific substance to&nbsp;refuel. Every 24 hours without the&nbsp;substance you suffer a level of fatigue and&nbsp;strife as your inner machinations begin to&nbsp;decay.</p>\n<p>Select one of the following.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Combustibles:</em> 1 pound of coal or&nbsp;hemp, or 2 pounds of wood.</li>\n<li><em>Darkness:</em> 2 hours of complete darkness.</li>\n<li><em>Liquid: </em>1 flask of lamp oil, grease, or an alchemical liquid of your choice.</li>\n<li><em>Metal: </em>1 pound of copper or roughly 50 copper pieces. The Narrator may also allow you to consume silver, gold, or other precious metal in an amount of equivalent worth instead.</li>\n<li><em>Sunlight: </em>3 hours of full sunlight or 6 hours of partial (shaded or cloudy) sunlight.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Mechanical Lift. </strong>You count as one size&nbsp;larger when determining your carrying&nbsp;capacity and you can carry a number of&nbsp;additional bulky items equal to your&nbsp;proficiency bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Planar Energy. </strong>Choose the type of&nbsp;planarite that serves as your primary life&nbsp;force from the following list: air, death,&nbsp;earth, fire, life, space, time, water. You&nbsp;gain resistance to a specific damage type&nbsp;based on this source.</p>\n<p>Regardless of planarite type, the&nbsp;planar energy contained within allows you&nbsp;to forgo sleep. When you take a long rest,&nbsp;you spend 4 hours in a state of inactivity&nbsp;(instead of sleeping for 6 hours). While&nbsp;powered down in this way, you suffer no&nbsp;penalty to passive Perception. A long rest&nbsp;remains 8 hours for you as normal, and&nbsp;the remainder of the time must be filled&nbsp;only with light activity.</p>\n<p><strong>TABLE: PLANARITE</strong></p>\n<table style=\"width: 100%; border-width: 1px; height: 155.172px;\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"height: 20.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 20.7969px;\">\n<h4><strong>Planarite</strong></h4>\n</td>\n<td style=\"height: 20.7969px;\">\n<h4><strong>Resistance</strong></h4>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">Air</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">Thunder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">Death</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">Necrotic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">Earth</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">Lightning</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">Fire</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">Fire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">Life</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">Radiant</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">Space</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">Psychic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">Time</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">Force</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">Water</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">Cold</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Constructed Gifts</h2>\n<p>In addition to the traits found in your&nbsp;constructed heritage, choose one of the&nbsp;following frames as your heritage gift.&nbsp;Cross-Functional.
