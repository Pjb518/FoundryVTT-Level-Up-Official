Your size is Small.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Fearless.</strong></em> You are immune to the effects of the frightened condition, whether caused by magic or by natural phenomena. You might still feel fear, but you are able to ignore it; alternatively you might be unable to even experience that emotion, and are unable to understand it in others.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Ravenfolk Nimbleness.</strong></em> You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Lucky.</strong></em> When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.</p>\n<h2>Ravenfolk Gifts</h2>\n<p>You have all the cunning of the raven and magpie. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<p><strong>Mimicry. </strong>Once you hear a noise, including when you hear a creature speak, you can mimic it perfectly. You gain an expertise die on checks made for vocal or auditory impersonation, and creatures have disadvantage on their Insight checks against them.</p>\n<p><strong>Rote Memory.</strong> Any words you can understand, written or spoken, you can recall with precision. You automatically succeed on checks made to recall such information, unless magic interferes with you. You gain an expertise die on saves made against effects that harm your memory, as well as on checks made to reproduce written or spoken information you know (such as with transcription or forgery).</p>\n<p><strong>Crow Artes. </strong>You are proficient with two skills of choice from Arcana, Acrobatics, Deception, Insight, Perception, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth.</p>\n<h2>Ravenfolk Paragon</h2>\n<p>When you reach 10th level, you are an exemplar of ravenfolkkind, and you gain the following paragon gift.</p>\n<h3>Increased Luck</h3>\n<p>When you use your Lucky trait, you may reroll results of 2 or 3.</p>",
