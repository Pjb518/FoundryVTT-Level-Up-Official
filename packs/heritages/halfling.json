Your size is Small.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Fearless.</strong></em> You are immune to the effects of the frightened condition, whether caused by magic or by natural phenomena. You might still feel fear, but you are able to ignore it; alternatively you might be unable to even experience that emotion, and are unable to understand it in others.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><em><strong>Halfling Nimbleness.</strong></em> You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Lucky.</strong></em> When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 39\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h1>Halfling Gifts</h1>\n<p>Halflings are widespread and the halflings from one borough may bear little resemblance to those from the other end of the world. There are a few prominent trends in halflings though. In addition to the traits found in your halfling heritage, select one of the following halfling gifts.</p>\n<h3>Burrowing Claws</h3>\n<p>If their creation myth is to be believed, halflings have a primordial form still represented by a trait sometimes seen today. You are significantly more hirsute than most halflings, and prone to patches of scruffy hair along your forearms and back. Your irises are often quite wide and deeply black, and your rocklike fingernails tend to grow with flattened edges. In halfling communities, these traits often come with insulting nicknames like &ldquo;shovel-claws&rdquo; or &ldquo;scruffs&rdquo;. You have the following traits:</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 40\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><em><strong>Burrow.</strong></em> You have a burrowing speed of 10 feet. You can use your burrowing speed to move through nonmagical sand, loose earth, loamy soil, mud, or snow, but not solid rock. You do not naturally leave any sort of tunnel behind but you can attempt to create a 5-foot by 5-foot wide tunnel in earth, soil, or snow by spending extra time and effort shoring it up and adding support. This reduces your burrowing speed to 5 feet every 15 minutes.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Claws.</strong></em> Your nails grow into strong shovel-like claws. The claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes that deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier.</p>\n<h3>Tuft Feet</h3>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 40\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>You have thick patches of bushy hair that grow atop your proportionally large feet. You don&rsquo;t need to wear shoes, or any sort of foot covering, as your big hairy feet are usually calloused and tough enough to tread on most anything. You have the following traits:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Big Feet.</strong></em> You gain an expertise die on checks and saving throws made to resist being knocked prone.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Thick Soles.</strong></em> You are immune to damage from sharp terrain hazards (such as caltrops, broken glass, or the spike growth spell) and ignore difficult terrain caused by them. Additionally, other kinds of difficult terrain reduces your movement speed by 5 feet instead of halving it.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 40\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h3>Twilight-Touched</h3>\n<p>You are blanched of both emotion and color with wide, alarmingly pure white eyes, and skin that is either starkly pallid or disquietingly sallow. There&rsquo;s no hair at all atop your head or you have only a few bedraggled locks of hair. You form stronger communal bonds than other halflings, and can speak without the need for words. You have the following traits:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> You can see in dim light within 30 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can&rsquo;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Telepathy.</strong></em> You can speak telepathically to any creature within 30 feet of you that you can see.&nbsp;The creature understands you only if the two of you share a language. You can speak telepathically in this way to one creature at a time.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 40\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h1>Halfling Paragon</h1>\n<p>When you reach 10th level, you are an exemplar of halflingkind, and you gain the following paragon gift.</p>\n<h3>Increased Luck</h3>\n<p>When you use your Lucky trait, you may reroll results of 2 or 3.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 40\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h1>Suggested Cultures</h1>\n<p>While you can choose any culture for your halfling character, the following cultures are linked closely with this heritage: kithbáin halfling, mustbairn halfling, stout halfling, tunnel halfling.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
