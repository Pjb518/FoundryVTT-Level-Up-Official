When you deal damage of that type, you can treat a creature with immunity to that damage as though it only had resistance, and you can treat a creature with resistance to that damage type as though it did not have resistance.</p>\n<p>When you roll for damage with your chosen damage type against a creature with neither immunity or resistance against it, re-roll any damage dice which land on a 1 until each damage die lands on a 2 or higher; replace the result.</p>\n<h2>Genasi Culture</h2>\n<p>Genasi are, as people, incredibly rare&mdash;even by planetouched standards. There are very few instances where elemental planetouched existed in such proportions as to make their own societies. The remarkably rare genasi nation leaves an indelible mark on a setting. They are often brought upon by a major magical occurrence: the emergence of genasi communities from another world, a massive upwelling of elemental magic, and interplanar collisions.</p>\n<p>Genasi are much more disposed either to adopt the culture they were born into, or set out at an early age to find people who understand them. Some genasi families, in their quest to assimilate, fall through the cracks of society&mdash;leading to a surprisingly high number of orphans who are secretly genasi. It also is rumored that some cultures and regions have higher odds of manifesting genasi children.</p>\n<h3>Suggested Cultures</h3>\n<p>While you can choose any culture for your genasi character, the following cultures are linked closely with this heritage: atlantean, circusfolk, elemental-bound, forsaken, islander, and lone wanderer.</p>",
