		"description": "<h2>Sipher Traits</h2>\n<p>Characters with the sipher heritage share the following traits:</p>\n<p><strong>Age.</strong> Siphers mature more slowly than humans and are typically found to settle down into an adult life in their late 60s. They can live to be nearly 300 years old.</p>\n<p><strong>Size.</strong> Small.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed. </strong>25 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\n<p><strong>Hiveminded.</strong> You draw strength from the hivemind, gaining an expertise die when making an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw. Once you have used this feature you cannot use it again until you have taken a long rest.</p>\n<p><strong>Insightful.</strong> A sipher’s life of connectivity grants them a natural intuitive empathy. You gain an expertise die when making Insight checks.</p>\n<h2>Sipher Gifts</h2>\n<p>While most siphers are born with a variety of ways to connect to and benefit from the hivemind, some are born without any connection at all. Some siphers are able to harness planetary energy, and use it to directly aid or harm those around them. In addition to the traits found in your sipher heritage, select one of the following gifts.</p>\n<h3>Core Child</h3>\n<p>A sipher born particularly close to a planet’s core amidst the heat, may have a particular kind of connection to such places. You have resistance to fire damage.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you are able to superheat yourself for one minute as a bonus action. While superheated, your skin glows red, and your unarmed attacks do fire damage. Any creature which touches you or which hits you with a natural weapon or unarmed attack automatically takes 1d6 fire damage. Once you have superheated yourself, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Earthmeld</h3>\n<p>You have a burrowing speed of 10 feet. As long as it has not been manipulated with psionic powers, you can use your burrowing speed to move through sand, loose earth, loamy soil, or mud, but not solid rock. You do not naturally leave any sort of tunnel behind, but you can attempt to create a 5-foot by 5-foot wide tunnel in earth or soil by spending extra time and effort shoring up and adding support. This reduces your burrowing speed to 5 feet every 15 minutes.</p>\n<h3>Energy Bolt</h3>\n<p>Choose an energy type from acid, cold, fire, and lightning. As an action you can muster a bolt of planetary energy and make a ranged attack with a range of 30 feet. This attack counts as a natural weapon for you. On a hit, the bolt does damage equal to 1d8 + your Dexterity modifier.</p>\n<h3>Hivebound</h3>\n<p>Some siphers are more connected to the hivemind than others. You can tap into the hivemind to gain advantage on an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw. You cannot use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Planetary Invocation</h3>\n<p>As an action you can touch a creature and channel planetary energy. The target regains hit points equal to your level. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. Your number of uses resets when you take a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Tremorsense</h3>\n<p>As long as you are in contact with the ground, you can sense vibrations and use them to pinpoint the location of anything that is moving and also in contact with the ground within 30 feet of you.</p>\n<h2>Sipher Paragon</h2>\n<p>Upon reaching 10th level, you become a personification of the ideals of your people. You gain one of the following paragon gifts.</p>\n<h3>Planetary Connection</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Core Child</em></p>\n<p>You gain immunity to fire damage.</p>\n<h3>Hivemind Expertise</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Hivebound</em></p>\n<p>Whenever you would make an ability check, you can use this gift to tap into the hivemind and gain an expertise die on the roll. You can use this gift a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all uses upon completing a long rest. Additionally, you gain proficiency with Intelligence saving throws. If you already had proficiency, you instead gain an expertise die.</p>\n<h3>Warded Mind</h3>\n<p>Your connection to the hivemind allows you to better ward yourself against psychic attacks. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws (if you already had proficiency, you instead gain an expertise die) and gain an expertise die on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saves to resist psionic abilities.</p>",
