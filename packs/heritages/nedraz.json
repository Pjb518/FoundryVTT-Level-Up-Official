		"description": "<h2>Nedraz Traits</h2><p>Characters of the Nedraz heritage share the following traits.</p><p><strong>Age.</strong> While Nedraz may be considered almost ageless through the stone sequestering, their people actually age at a rate similar to humans, though they reach their full height by fifteen or sixteen, after their twelfth or thirteenth shedding of skin, they don’t reach physical and mental maturity until the early 20s after their final molting.</p><p><strong>Size.</strong> While comparatively slender and sinuous, the addition of a tail causes nedraz to weigh about as much as humans of their height. Your size is Medium.</p><p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base Speed is 30 feet.</p><p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> Ancient Nedraz engineered themselves to have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p><p><strong>Heightened Senses.</strong> Ancient Nedraz also used their strange sciences to manipulate their population’s ability to taste and sense the world around them. With a flicker of tongue or the tilt of your head towards or away from heat, you may spend a bonus action to gain an expertise die to locate food or creatures, including dead ones, with perception or survival checks. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all uses at the end of a long rest.</p><p><strong>Sinuous.</strong> You gain an expertise die on saving throws against being grappled, bound, or targeted by effects which limit movement with physical objects.</p><h2>Nedraz Gifts</h2><h3>Mesmerist</h3><p>Locking eyes with your target, your swaying head and soothing voice disarm their defenses and allow you entry to their mind. You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You gain the Empathic Interference power</p></li><li><p>At 3rd level you gain a reservoir with a single 1d4 psi die</p></li><li><p>At 5th level you gain a second 1d4 psi die</p></li><li><p>Your manifestation ability is Intelligence or Charisma, chosen at level 1</p></li></ul><h3>Serpentine</h3><p>Unlike the majority of nedraz you do not possess separate and distinct legs, but instead your entire lower body is a serpent’s tail. You gain the following traits.</p><p><strong>Coiled Strikes.</strong> By expending your bonus action you can increase your reach by 5ft until the start of your next turn.</p><p><strong>Slither.</strong> Your base speed becomes 40ft and you gain a climb and swim speed of 20ft.</p><h3>Enhanced Form</h3><p>One or more of your ancestors were engineered to have powerful reserves of strength. It takes more to fatigue your muscles and you can use short bursts of power to accomplish your goals. You gain the following traits.</p><p><strong>Burst of Effort.</strong> You may spend a bonus action to gain an expertise die to the roll of any strength based ability or skill check. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all uses at the end of a long rest.</p><p><strong>Carrier.</strong> You are able to carry an additional bulky item, and add your proficiency to your strength score to determine your carrying capacity.</p><p><strong>Enduring.</strong> You do not take penalties when you gain your first level of fatigue, and delay the effects of fatigue by one level. I.E. you cannot sprint or dash at fatigue 2, and your hit dice are halved at fatigue 6. You still become doomed at fatigue 7.</p><h2>Nedraz Paragon</h2><p>When you reach 10th level you are an exemplar of what it is to be a nedraz. And you gain one paragon gift from the following list.</p><h3>Mind of Mayhem</h3><p>You have been exposed to such strange thoughts on your journey and it has altered the way you think, to some degree.</p><ul><li><p>You gain the Telepathy power.</p></li><li><p>You gain the Warp Perception power.</p></li><li><p>It is impossible to read your mind against your will.</p></li></ul><h3>Strange Sciences</h3><p>Your experiences in the realms of psionics and mortal forms has granted you significant insight into modifying yourself, and others.</p><ul><li><p>You gain the Body Manipulation power and can target other creatures with it.</p></li><li><p>You gain two d4 psi dice in a reservoir or added to your reservoir.</p></li><li><p>Your manifestation is Intelligence or Charisma, chosen when you gain this gift.</p></li></ul>",
