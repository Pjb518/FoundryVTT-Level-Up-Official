		"description": "<h2>Chrysalian Traits</h2>\n<p>Characters with the chrysalian heritage share a variety of traits in common with one another.</p>\n<p><strong>Fey Lineage.</strong> You are suffused with the vibrant energy of the fey realms. You have the fey creature type.</p>\n<p><strong>Age.</strong> Chrysalians age faster than humans, reaching maturity at 12 years and typically living to be 60&ndash;75 years old.</p>\n<p><strong>Size.</strong> Chrysalians are usually 2&ndash;3 feet tall and weigh no more than 20&ndash;25 pounds. Your size is Small.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Antennae.</strong> You have a pair of antennae that are either sleek or feathery. You are able to distinguish scents keenly and gain an expertise die on Perception and Investigation checks involving smell, and to other rolls where scent is important.</p>\n<p><strong>Glorious Wings.</strong> You have a fly speed of 30 feet. You cannot fly if you are wearing armor that has a Strength requirement, if you are currently carrying an object that weighs a number of pounds equal to twice your Strength score, or if you are currently encumbered. You may, however, utilize magic items that increase your Armor Class and use light shields if you are proficient.</p>\n<p>If your movement speed is reduced to 0 or you are incapacitated, you fall at a rate of 30 feet per round.</p>\n<h2>Chrysalian Gifts</h2>\n<p>In addition to the traits found in your chrysalian heritage, select one of the following gifts.</p>\n<h3>Aerial Ace</h3>\n<p>Though all chrysalians are graceful fliers, you have mastered your skills on the wing. You may double your movement speed on your turn if you are using your fly speed. You may not use this ability again until you have spent at least one turn where you do not expend any movement.</p>\n<h3>Healing Touch</h3>\n<p>You are imbued with the inherent calm of the fey realm&rsquo;s eternal twilight. As an action, you may touch a creature and restore to it a number of hit points equal to your level. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.</p>\n<h3>Perplexing Riddle</h3>\n<p>Every fey being loves a good riddle. You may use your action to pose a riddle to one creature you can see within 30 feet. The creature must be able to understand you. That creature must then succeed on a Wisdom saving throw versus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score (whichever is highest) to try and answer the riddle. On a failure, it is rattled until the end of its next turn. Creatures that have an Intelligence score less than 4 or are immune to being stunned are unaffected by this trait. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.</p>\n<h2>Chrysalian Paragon</h2>\n<p>When you reach 10th level, you become a better chrysalian and gain one paragon gift from the following list.</p>\n<h3>Debilitating Cloud</h3>\n<p>You have learned how to weaponize the minuscule scales on your wings, turning them into an airborne powder that can incapacitate your enemies. As an action, you can flap your wings, expelling a cloud of scales in a radius of 30 feet. All creatures within range make a Constitution saving throw versus your maneuver DC. On a failure, they are stunned until the start of your next turn. Creatures that do not need to breathe or are immune to the stunned condition are unaffected. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.</p>\n<h3>Technicolor Vision</h3>\n<p>Your eyes are able to discern colors and light patterns that most humanoids cannot see, granting you improved sight. You can see invisible creatures and objects and gain darkvision to 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, it increases by 60 feet. Additionally, you have advantage on ability checks to recognize or see through visual illusory effects within 30 feet, such as major or minor image, as well as on saving throws against spells or effects that utilize visual illusions, such as the fear spell.</p>\n<h3>Winged Champion</h3>\n<p>You have truly mastered flight and endurance beyond what most chrysalians are capable of. Your fly speed increases to 40 feet. Additionally, you may now wear armor that has a Strength requirement, provided that you meet the requirements necessary to wear the armor normally. The rules for hovering still apply.</p>",
