		"description": "<h2>Lapidarian Traits</h2>\n<p>Characters with the lapidarian heritage share a variety of traits in common with one another.</p>\n<p><strong>Age.</strong> Lapidarians are slow to mature but incredibly long-lived. They are considered to be adults when they reach their first century and can live upwards of 1,000 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Size.</strong> Lapidarians are of a similar size to humans. They typically are between 5&ndash;6 feet tall, though some are shorter, and they can weigh anywhere between 100 and 300 pounds. You size is Medium, though you may be Small with Narrator&rsquo;s permission.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet, or 25 feet if you are Small.</p>\n<p><strong>Cavern Sight.</strong> You can see in dim light within 30 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cannot discern individual colors in the darkness, only shades of the same color as your skin (blue, red, etc.).</p>\n<p><strong>Empath.</strong> You naturally have a heightened awareness of the feelings and emotions of those around you. You gain an expertise die to Insight checks made against other creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Positive Vibes.</strong> One might say that you light up a room with your energy, even amongst strangers. You learn the friends cantrip.</p>\n<h2>Lapidarian Gifts</h2>\n<p>In addition to the traits found in your lapidarian heritage, select one of the following gifts.</p>\n<h3>Crystal Magic</h3>\n<p>Your body serves as a natural conduit for arcane energies as well as emotional ones. You know the resistance cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you may cast the spell protection from evil and good once per long rest. At 5th level, you may cast calm emotions once per long rest. You do not require material components for these spells, and your spellcasting ability for them is either Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, whichever is highest.</p>\n<h3>Crystalline Ring</h3>\n<p>Your crystalline skin rings when struck. When an enemy hits you with a melee weapon attack, you may immediately use your reaction to sustain the ringing to disorient your foe. The triggering creature makes a Wisdom saving throw versus your maneuver DC. On a failure, it is rattled until the start of your next turn. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.</p>\n<h3>Energy Absorption</h3>\n<p>Choose a damage type from the following list: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. When you take damage of that type, you store some of its power to unleash it back on your foes. When you hit with your next attack, you may channel that energy into your strike and add 1d4 of the chosen type to your damage. This increases to 2d4 at 5th level, 3d4 at 11th level, and 4d4 at 17th level. &nbsp;You may use this ability a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier per long rest.</p>\n<h2>Lapidarian Paragon</h2>\n<p>When you reach 10th level, you become a better lapidarian and gain one paragon gift from the following list.</p>\n<h3>Crystal Healing</h3>\n<p>Your ability to absorb and cleanse the energy around you extends to your allies as well. You learn the spell greater restoration and may cast it once per long rest without using material components or expending a spell slot.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when short resting in your presence, you and your allies gain an additional number of hit points equal to twice your proficiency bonus.</p>\n<h3>Diamond Hide</h3>\n<p>Your crystal skin grows harder and tougher, making you more durable and resistant to certain damage types. You gain resistance to non-magical slashing damage.<br>Additionally, your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to your level when you take this paragon gift, and when calculating the amount of HP that you gain at level up, add 1 additional hit point.</p>\n<h3>Energy Redirection</h3>\n<p>You form an unseen bond with your allies, allowing you to absorb some of the damage that they would otherwise take. When an allied creature within 30 feet that you can see would take damage from an attack or a spell, you may use your reaction to absorb that damage instead. Once you have used this ability, you may not do so again until you complete a short or a long rest.</p>",
