		"description": "<h2>Hortican Traits</h2>\n<p>Characters with the hortican heritage share a variety of traits in common with one another.</p>\n<p><strong>Botanical Nature.</strong> Your body is made of leaves, vines, flowers, and other plantlike growth rather than flesh, even if it appears largely humanoid. In addition to being humanoid, you also gain the plant creature type.</p>\n<p><strong>Age.</strong> Horticans are typically slow to age. They reach maturity at 20 and can easily live upwards of 200 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Size.</strong> Horticans typically stand anywhere between 5&ndash;7 feet tall and can weigh anywhere from 90 to 200 pounds. Your size is Medium, though you may be Small with your Narrator&rsquo;s permission.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet, or 25 feet if you are Small.</p>\n<p><strong>Botanic Constitution.</strong> You gain an expertise die to saving throws made to resist poison and the poisoned condition.</p>\n<p><strong>Natural Camouflage.</strong> You have advantage on Stealth checks made in areas with heavy vegetation, such as woodlands and jungles.</p>\n<p><strong>Plantspeak.</strong> You innately know how to speak to and understand the language of plants. You may use this to gain information from nearby plants about the surrounding area or recent visitors, but cannot command the plants in any other way.</p>\n<h2>Hortican Gifts</h2>\n<p>In addition to the traits found in your hortican heritage, choose two from the following gifts.</p>\n<h3>Aquatic Adaptation</h3>\n<p>Your plantlike form is adapted to the aquatic life of cattails and lilypads. You gain a swim speed equal to your Speed, and you do not need to breathe when you are underwater.</p>\n<h3>Edible Fruits</h3>\n<p>Parts of your body produce fruit, such as berries or apples. Once per long rest, you may pluck one of these fruits and administer it to a creature (the creature can be yourself), restoring a number of hit points equal to your level.</p>\n<h3>Epiphytic</h3>\n<p>You have the characteristics of plants who grow among the lofty branches of trees, such as orchids. You gain a climb speed equal to your Speed, and you gain an expertise die to checks made to resist the effects of high altitudes.</p>\n<h3>Leaf&rsquo;s Descent</h3>\n<p>Like a dandelion&rsquo;s seed, you gently drift down when you fall. You fall at a slower rate (as in the spell feather fall) and are immune to fall damage.</p>\n<h3>Scented Blooms</h3>\n<p>Parts of your body are covered in brilliant flowers that give off a pleasing scent. You gain an expertise die to Persuasion checks. Additionally, creatures within 10 feet of you gain an expertise die to saving throws made to resist horrible or dangerous smells.</p>\n<h3>Thorny Hide</h3>\n<p>Parts of your skin are covered in sharp thorns or spines. When you are not wearing armor and a creature hits you with a melee weapon attack that uses natural weapons such as claws, jaws, or their fists, or begins its turn grappling you, it takes an amount of piercing damage equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>\n<h3>Weed&rsquo;s Tenacity</h3>\n<p>Like a weed growing through the smallest crack in the road, you too possess superior squeezing skills. When squeezing, count yourself as one size smaller.</p>\n<h3>Vine Whip</h3>\n<p>You have the ability to conjure a whiplike vine from one of your limbs. So long as you have one hand free, as a bonus action you may produce this vine and make a melee weapon attack against a creature. This vine has all of the properties of a whip for the purposes of calculating its reach and damage. Once you have used the whip, it reabsorbs into your limb until conjured again. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.</p>\n<h2>Hortican Paragon</h2>\n<p>When you reach 10th level, you become a better hortican and gain one paragon gift from the following list.</p>\n<h3>Botanical Evolution</h3>\n<p>Instead of a paragon gift, you may choose to swap out one of your existing heritage gifts with another. This choice must be made at the start of the adventuring day and cannot be changed until you complete a long rest.</p>\n<h3>One with Nature</h3>\n<p>You are in tune with the natural world around you. You learn the spell commune with nature and may always cast it as a ritual. It does not count against the number of spells you know.</p>\n<h3>Photosynthesis</h3>\n<p>You gain all of your daily nutrition from the sun. You no longer need to consume Supply so long as you are able to receive at least 8 hours of sunlight a day. Also, while short resting in direct sunlight, roll an additional hit die when you restore hit points.</p>",
