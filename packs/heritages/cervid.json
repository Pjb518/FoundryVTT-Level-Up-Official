		"description": "<h2>Cervid Traits</h2>\n<p>Characters with the cervid heritage share a variety of traits in common with one another.</p>\n<p><strong>Age.</strong> Cervids mature and age at a similar rate to humans.</p>\n<p><strong>Size.</strong> Most cervids are slightly taller than humans, typically standing between 6&ndash;7 feet tall (not including their antlers) and weigh between 150-300 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Fleet-Footed.</strong> You may use a bonus action to Hide or Disengage.</p>\n<p><strong>Naturally Shod.</strong> You have a pair of cloven hooves instead of bare feet, meaning you cannot wear regular footwear such as boots and other shoes. However, your hooves are naturally hard and tough. Choose one type of terrain your deerlike form is adapted to: desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or tundra. You ignore naturally-occurring difficult terrain in that environment. You also take half damage from sharp terrain hazards, such as sharp rocks or broken glass.<br><strong>Specialized Senses.</strong> You gain an expertise die on Perception checks made within the terrain you chose for your Naturally Shod feature.</p>\n<h2>Cervid Gifts</h2>\n<p>Cervids come in a variety of shapes and sizes, from slim and elegant to broad and barrel-chested. In addition to the traits found in your cervid heritage, select one of the following gifts.</p>\n<h3>Fleet Feet</h3>\n<p>You gain proficiency in Perception checks, or an expertise die if you were already proficient. Additionally, your base Speed increases by 5 feet and you may make a 10-foot leap in any direction. This leap does not provoke opportunity attacks. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.</p>\n<h3>Regal Antlers</h3>\n<p>Though plenty of cervids have antlers, yours are particularly impressive&mdash;and dangerous. While this means you cannot wear headgear such as helmets, circlets, and diadems, you gain proficiency in Intimidation checks and you may always choose to use Strength when making Intimidation checks. Your antlers are also more than just for show. Choose bludgeoning or piercing damage. As a bonus action you may make an unnarmed strike, dealing damage of the chosen type equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. This strike does not require the use of your hands to execute.</p>\n<h3>Watch Your Back</h3>\n<p>There&rsquo;s strength in numbers, especially when you have someone to watch your back. When you are adjacent to an ally, you gain the benefits of being positioned back-to-back without having to expend your bonus action.</p>\n<h2>Cervid Paragon</h2>\n<p>When you reach 10th level, you exemplify the best aspects of your kind and gain one paragon gift from the following list.</p>\n<h3>Monarch of the Wilds</h3>\n<p>You gain an expertise die in Intimidation checks. Additionally, as a bonus action, you can draw on the terrifying majesty of the wilderness, stomping and pawing at the ground or giving a mighty battlecry. All creatures you choose within a 30-foot radius must make a Wisdom saving throw versus your passive Intimidation. On a failure, they become frightened of you until the start of your next turn. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.</p>\n<h3>Like the Wind</h3>\n<p>Your Speed increases by 10 feet and you ignore difficult terrain when you Dash. When you make a melee weapon attack against a creature, until the end of your next turn you do not provoke opportunity attacks from it.</p>\n<h3>With the Herd</h3>\n<p>You use your natural mobility to provide your allies a means of escape in the heat of battle. You learn the combat maneuver Doubletime. It does not count against the number of maneuvers you know and you may activate it without consuming exertion. Once you have used this ability, you may not do so again until you complete a long rest.</p>",
