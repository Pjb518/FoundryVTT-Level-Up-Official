		"description": "<h2>Strix Traits</h2>\n<p>Strix are owlfolk who are quite hardy in spite of their avian nature.</p>\n<p><strong>Age. </strong>Strix reach full maturity well before 8 years. Few live longer than half a century.</p>\n<p><strong>Size. </strong>Strix prefer to crouch and it is hard to state their average upright height; body length varies from 4 to 7 feet. Their build is even more slender than elves, but their feathers frequently make them look more robust. Your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed. </strong>You have a base walking speed of 25 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Mighty Wings. </strong>You have a fly speed of 50 feet. To use this speed, you can&rsquo;t be wearing medium or heavy armor, nor can you be encumbered (if using variant encumbrance). Because of your large wing span, while flying you occupy the the space of a Huge-sized creature (15 feet wide). You cannot squeeze through smaller spaces while flying. Due to being a larger target, when you fly, attack rolls against you have advantage until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Aided Leap. </strong>Even when you cannot use your wings to fly, you can use them to aid you in your jumps. As long as you are not wearing medium or heavy armor, and are not encumbered (if using variant encumbrance), you may determine your jump distance with your Dexterity, your jumps count as having made a running start, and your jump distance is doubled.</p>\n<p><strong>Aided Fall. </strong>Your wings also slow your fall. When you fall, unless you choose not to, your wings slow your fall to a speed of 150 feet per round; at this speed, you have resistance to damage from falling. You can slow your fall speed even further as a reaction, to a fall rate of 60 feet per round; at this speed, you take no damage from falling.</p>\n<p><strong>Claws. </strong>The claws on your feet are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes dealing 1d4 slashing damage. They have the finesse property.</p>\n<p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> Your strix blood grants you superior vision in dark or dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\n<p><strong>Heavy Lifter.</strong> When determining your carrying capacity and the weight that you can push, drag, or lift, your size is considered to be Large.</p>\n<p>Note: A creature can only be considered a maximum of one size larger or smaller when determining how much Supply and weight it can carry.</p>\n<p><strong>Mighty Attacks.</strong> When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon&rsquo;s damage dice an additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.</p>\n<h2>Strix Paragon</h2>\n<p>When you reach 10th level, you are an exemplar of the strix. You gain one paragon gift from the following list.</p>\n<h3>Acrobatic Aerialist</h3>\n<p>Even with your wingspan, you can flutter through tight spaces, ignoring the 15 foot space requirement of your Mighty Wings. While airborne, if you are subject to an attack, you use your reaction to remove the advantage you grant on that attack.</p>\n<h3>Aerial Dreadnought</h3>\n<p>Medium armor, heavy armor, and encumbrance do not prevent your use of Mighty Wings or Aided Leap.</p>\n<h3>Natural Aeromancy</h3>\n<p>Choose two spell schools from the following: air, lighting, storm, senses, weather. All spells of the schools you chose are added to your class spell list for you.</p>",
