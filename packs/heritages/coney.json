		"description": "<h2>Coney Traits</h2>\n<p>Characters with the coney heritage share a variety of traits in common with one another.</p>\n<p><strong>Age.</strong> Coneys age at a similar rate to humans.</p>\n<p><strong>Size.</strong> Coneys are similar in size to humans, typically standing between 5&ndash;6 feet tall (not including their ears) and weighing between 120-150 lbs. Your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Alert Ears.</strong> Your long ears grant you superior hearing ability. You gain an expertise die on Perception checks based on hearing.</p>\n<p><strong>Powerful Legs.</strong> Your long legs are specially designed for power. You gain proficiency in Athletics and an expertise die on Athletics checks made to jump.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you may use your bonus action to kick your opponent. On a hit, you deal 1d6 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage.</p>\n<h2>Coney Gifts</h2>\n<p>In addition to the traits found in your coney heritage, select one of the following gifts.</p>\n<h3>Hide in Plain Sight</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, hiding is more advantageous than a direct assault.You gain proficiency in Stealth. When you take the Hide action, roll your check with advantage.</p>\n<h3>In a Single Bound</h3>\n<p>You have mastered your natural-born ability to dart and leap. &nbsp;Your Speed increases by 5 feet. When calculating how far you can jump you are always considered to have made a running start (even if you are stationary), and when executing a long jump you may jump a number of feet equal to three times your Strength score.</p>\n<h3>Lapine Luck</h3>\n<p>Whether it&rsquo;s through quick thinking or just preternatural luck, you have a knack for avoiding bad outcomes. Once per long rest, if you fail a d20 roll for an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw you may immediately reroll the die (or one die if you rolled with advantage or disadvantage). You must use the result of the second roll.</p>\n<h2>Coney Paragon</h2>\n<p>When you reach 10th level, you become a better coney and gain one paragon gift from the following list.</p>\n<h3>Covert Cover</h3>\n<p>You have learned to leverage terrain to the greatest degree. You gain the benefits of full cover when you would normally have three-quarters cover, and three-quarters cover when you would have half cover.</p>\n<h3>Quick Reflexes</h3>\n<p>You learn the First Blood combat maneuver. This does not count towards the number of maneuvers you know and you may activate it without consuming exertion. Once you have used this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Rapid Kick</h3>\n<p>When you use your Powerful Legs feature to attack, treat your attacks as magical for the purposes of overcoming damage resistance. Additionally, when you hit with your kick, you may make a number of additional kick attacks equal to half of your proficiency bonus (rounded down).</p>",
