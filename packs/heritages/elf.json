    "description": "<h2>Elf Traits</h2>\n<p>Characters with the elf heritage share a variety of traits in common with one another.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Elf children mature at the same rate as human children, but elvish cultures do not consider them to be fully mentally developed (nor matured) until they acquire a century of life experience. Elves today can live to be 700 or older, and legends speak of elves who simply never die.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Elves have a slender and graceful build. Some stand as tall as average humans, although most are a head or so shorter. Your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> Having your ancestral origins in the twilight realms, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can&rsquo;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Fey Ancestry.</strong></em> You gain an expertise die on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can&rsquo;t put you to sleep.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Trance.</strong></em> Elves don&rsquo;t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining conscious (the Common word for such meditation is &ldquo;trance.&rdquo;) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that became reflexive through years of practice. When you take a long rest, you spend 4 hours in your trance state (instead of sleeping for 6 hours). During the trance you suffer no penalty to passive Perception. A long rest remains 8 hours for you as normal, and the remainder of the time must be filled only with light activity.</p>\n<h2>Elf Gifts</h2>\n<p>Elves are known for their uncanny perceptiveness, which according to some can even extend to the power to read minds and see the future &mdash; although such powers are very rare. In addition to the traits found in your elf heritage, select one of the following gifts.</p>\n<h3>Mystic Rapport</h3>\n<p>Some elves are so attuned to the arcane that they can see magical energy with their eyes, sense the presence of nearby elves, and communicate mentally.</p>\n<p>Elves with the gift of Mystic Rapport have the following traits:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Arcane Sensitivity.</strong></em> You gain proficiency in Arcana.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Arcane Empathy.</strong></em> Your sensitivity to the flow of magic lets you speak to the hearts of others. You have a limited ability to communicate telepath- ically with those within 30 feet of you. Though this grants the target no ability to respond telepathically, they can understand you as long as you share a language with them.</p>\n<h3>Prescient Vision</h3>\n<p>Some elves don&rsquo;t live in the present moment, their spirits shifting back and forth in the currents of time. Although mainly used for contemplation, this mystical experience is also useful for predicting what may yet come to pass &mdash; though like sand in the waves, the future is always churning.</p>\n<p>Elves with the gift of Prescient Vision have the following trait:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Glance the Future. </strong></em>Your eyes can see a few moments into the future, and your mind appre- hends the divergent possibilities. Once between rests you can use a bonus action to roll a d20 and record the result. Before the end of your next short or long rest, when a creature you can see within 60 feet makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to replace their roll with your recorded result. When the creature is also rolling an expertise die, only the d20 roll is replaced. When the creature is rolling more than one d20, such as when it has advan- tage or when a halfling is using their Lucky trait, the replacement applies to the creature&rsquo;s final roll. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Preternatural Awareness</h3>\n<p>The conventional senses of elves are thought to be more finely tuned than those of other mortals. Some scholars debate whether it is merely a matter of sensitivity, or if the elvish trance meditation heightens their awareness in a way other mortals simply are unable to rival.</p>\n<p>Elves with the gift of Preternatural Awareness have the following traits:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Keen Senses.</strong></em> You gain proficiency in Perception.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Prophetic Instincts.</strong></em> Your ability to detect danger is nearly supernatural. You gain a bonus to initiative rolls equal to your Wisdom modifier, and you can&rsquo;t be surprised while conscious (including during your Trance).</p>\n<h2>Elven Paragon</h2>\n<p>When you reach 10th level, you are an exemplar of elfkind, and you gain one paragon gift from the following list.</p>\n<h3>Elfsight</h3>\n<p>Nature cannot block the legendary accuracy of your people. Your attack rolls ignore half cover, and an area being lightly obscured does not impose disadvantage on your ability checks. You do not have disadvantage from making ranged attacks at long range.</p>\n<h3>Inexorable Darkvision</h3>\n<p>There is no range limit for your darkvision.</p>\n<h3>Spiritual Awareness</h3>\n<p>You are able to cast detect thoughts a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus between each long rest. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (whichever is highest).</p>\n<h2>Suggested Cultures</h2>\n<p>While you can choose any culture for your elf char- acter, the following cultures are linked closely with this heritage: eladrin, high elf, shadow elf, wood elf.</p>",
