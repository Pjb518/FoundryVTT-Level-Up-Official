		"description": "<h2>Sprite Traits</h2>\n<p>Characters with the sprite heritage share a variety of traits in common with one another.</p>\n<p><strong>Fey Lineage.</strong> Your form is full to the brim with the whimsy of the fey realms. Your creature type is fey.</p>\n<p><strong>Age.</strong> Like many fey, sprites are quick to mature but very long-lived. They typically reach maturity at 15 and can live upwards of 300 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Size.</strong> Sprites never exceed 2 feet tall and typically weigh 5-10 lbs. Your size is Tiny.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 20 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Faerie Light.</strong> As a bonus action, you may produce a halo of dim light around yourself in a 30-foot radius. This light may be any color of your choosing. Extinguishing this light requires a bonus action.</p>\n<p><strong>Flit and Flutter.</strong> You have a pair of insect-like wings. These may be translucent, like a dragonfly or a bee, or they may be solid and brightly colored. You have a fly speed of 25 feet. You cannot fly if you are wearing armor that has a Strength requirement, if you are currently carrying an object that weighs a number of pounds equal to twice your Strength score, or if you are currently encumbered. You may, however, utilize magic items that increase your Armor Class and use light shields if you are proficient.</p>\n<p>If your movement speed is reduced to 0 or you are incapacitated, you fall at a rate of 30 feet per round.</p>\n<p>The rules for hovering still apply to you.</p>\n<h2>Sprite Gifts</h2>\n<p>In addition to the traits found in your sprite heritage, select one of the following gifts.</p>\n<h3>Boisterous Buzz</h3>\n<p>You learn the bothersome buzzing cantrip. Additionally, when you or one of your allies within 30 feet of you is hit with a melee weapon attack, you may use your reaction to vigorously vibrate your wings, creating a loud buzzing or whirring sound that can drive the enemy to distraction. You or the triggering ally may immediately roll 1d4 and add the result to your/their AC, potentially causing the enemy to miss. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.</p>\n<h3>Glittery Escape</h3>\n<p>You tap into your innate fey lineage to help get you out of a tight spot. As a bonus action, you disappear in a cloud of glitter and immediately teleport to an unoccupied square you can see within 15 feet. Creatures within 5 feet of you when you activate this ability must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become dazzled (pg. 68) until the start of your next turn. Once you have used this ability, you may not do so again until you complete a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Wild Child</h3>\n<p>You naturally lean into the wilder aspects of the fey realms, manifesting more primal traits. You have advantage on skill checks that rely on hearing or smell.</p>\n<p>Additionally, once per long rest you may shapeshift into a Tiny beast of CR 0. While in this form, you gain 1d4 temporary hit points. You may stay in this form for a number of hours equal to your Constitution modifier or until your temporary hit points are reduced to 0, at which point you revert back to your normal form.</p>\n<h2>Sprite Paragon</h2>\n<p>When you reach 10th level, you become a better sprite and gain one paragon gift from the following list.</p>\n<h3>Dragonfly Flight</h3>\n<p>Your mastery of flight surpasses that of normal sprites. Your fly speed increases to 35 feet. Additionally, you may now wear armor that has a Strength requirement and retain your ability to fly.</p>\n<h3>Now You See Me&hellip;</h3>\n<p>You harness your fey powers to give your enemies the slip. You may turn yourself and all of your carried items invisible for 1 minute, as in the spell greater invisibility. Once you have used this ability, you may not do so again until you complete a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Small but Mighty</h3>\n<p>Your larger-than-life personality more than makes up for your Tiny size, and it now has a way to manifest physically. You may cast the spell enlarge/reduce on yourself a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest. The spell can only target you and can only be used with the Enlarge option.</p>",
