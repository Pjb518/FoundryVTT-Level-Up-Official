		"description": "<p>This map was used by the dwarves of Deephall Point to flee Cirothe&rsquo;s assault on their homeland but it is not simply a drawing of a secret route (though it is that, too), it is a powerful artifact that helps any fleeing danger to find their refuge.</p>\n<p>While holding the map, you can gaze into it and envision a place you want to go. The map then depicts a path to that destination that is as free of danger as possible. The terrain, features, and route all appear as if some unseen hand is drawing it in front of your eyes making it impossible for you to become lost. In addition, once per day the map shows where you are likely to have a random encounter (allowing you to avoid the area altogether).</p>\n<p>DESTRUCTION</p>\n<p>If you are in possession of the map and take fire damage from the breath weapon of a red dragon, you automatically fail your Dexterity saving throw and the map is destroyed. Otherwise the relic cannot be damaged.</p>",
