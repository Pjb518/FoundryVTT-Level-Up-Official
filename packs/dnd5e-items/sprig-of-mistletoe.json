Those who heed nature's call are able to harness this connection to call forth the incredible power of nature.</p>\n<p><strong>Spellcasting Focus</strong>. A druidic focus is a special item designed to channel the power of spells from the druid's spell list. A druid can use such an item as a spellcasting focus, using it in place of any material component which does not list a cost.</p>",
