Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.</p><p>Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: Celestials, Elementals, fey, Fiends, or Undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The creature can't willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.</li>\n<li>The creature has disadvantage on Attack rolls against Targets within the Cylinder.</li>\n<li>Targets within the cylinder can't be Charmed, Frightened, or possessed by the creature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the Duration increases by 1 Hour for each slot level above 3rd.</p>",
