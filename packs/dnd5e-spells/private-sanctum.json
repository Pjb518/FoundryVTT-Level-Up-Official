		"description": "<p>You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the Duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.</p><p>When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.</li>\n<li>The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it.</li>\n<li>Sensors created by Divination spells can't appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.</li>\n<li>Creatures in the area can't be targeted by divination spells.</li>\n<li>Nothing can Teleport into or out of the warded area.</li>\n<li>Planar Travel is blocked within the warded area.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels</strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.</p>",
