Creatures of your choice in that radius when you cast this spell shed dim light in a 5-foot radius and have advantage on all Saving Throws, and other creatures have disadvantage on Attack rolls against them until the spell ends. In addition, when a fiend or an Undead hits an affected creature with a melee attack, the aura flashes with brilliant light. The attacker must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be Blinded until the spell ends.</p>",
