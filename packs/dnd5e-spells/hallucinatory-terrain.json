		"description": "<p>You make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, Equipment, and creatures within the area aren't changed in appearance.</p><p>The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the Illusion. If the difference isn't obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the Illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the Illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.</p>",
