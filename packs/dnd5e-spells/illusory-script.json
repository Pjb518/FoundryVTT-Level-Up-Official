To all others, the writing appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical script that is unintelligible. Alternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to be an entirely different message, written in a different hand and language, though the language must be one you know.</p><p>Should the spell be dispelled, the original script and the Illusion both disappear.</p><p>A creature with Truesight can read the hidden message.</p>",
