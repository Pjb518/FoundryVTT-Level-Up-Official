If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.</p><p>The spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen such a creature up close—within 30 feet—at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as being under the effects of a polymorph spell, this spell doesn't locate the creature.</p><p>This spell can't locate a creature if running water at least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path between you and the creature.</p>",
