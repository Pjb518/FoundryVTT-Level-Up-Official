		"description": "<p>A character can use the Work activity to pay their cost of living expenses and earn some coin between adventures. Work is broken down into two categories. On a successful check after spending a week on this downtime activity, a character supports a lifestyle (poor, moderate, or rich, and earns gold as listed on Table: Work.</p>\n<p><strong>Legal Work.</strong> Legal work allows a character to practice a trade or profession without fear of consequence. The character selects a tool proficiency or skill approved by the Narrator and makes an ability check, consulting Table: Work to determine the lifestyle their profits support and the extra gold earned. On a result of 5 or less, a character earns nothing, supports no lifestyle, and has disadvantage on the next Work check that they make using the same skill or tool.</p>\n<p><strong>Illegal Work.</strong> Illegal work allows a character to sustain themself and make some coin by engaging in petty crime. First, a character selects the type of crime that they would like to engage in and selects an appropriate skill or ability check approved by the Narrator. They then select the difficulty of criminal activities as per Table: Work.</p>\n<p>On a failed check, a character receives no earnings and must cover the cost of their lifestyle themselves. If they fail by 5 or more, the character must lay low and cannot take a downtime activity for the following week, and on a failure by 10 or more they are caught and suffer consequences or complications determined by the Narrator.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Table: Work</strong></p>\n<table style=\"width: 51.068%;\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 25.1908%;\"><col style=\"width: 11.4504%;\"><col style=\"width: 26.7001%;\"><col style=\"width: 36.6586%;\"></colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Difficulty</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">DC</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Lifestyle</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Earnings</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Easy</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Poor</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">[[/r 1d6]] gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Average</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">15</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Moderate</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">[[/r 3d6]] gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hard</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">20</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Rich</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">[[/r 6d6]] gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Very Hard</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">25</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Rich</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">[[/r 10d6]] gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
