		"description": "<p>Religious Devotion allows a character to engage in acts of piety in an attempt to appease the gods and earn their favor. In order to engage in this downtime activity, a character must have access to a shrine, temple, or other sacred site and spend the required gold on sacred offerings to make a Nature or Religion check against a DC from Table: Religious Devotion. On a success, the character gains 1 point of favor, plus 1 additional point of favor for every 5 points their result exceeds the DC.</p>\n<p><strong>Favor.</strong> A point of favor can be spent to represent a minor but helpful boon that aligns with a deity’s portfolio. A point of favor from a war god might allow a character to find a weapon after they’ve been disarmed, while a point of favor from a nature god might make it easier to find a safe place to camp.</p>\n<p>The specific details are left up to the Narrator, but in general, this should represent advantage on a roll, the discovery of a small but useful item, or a helpful chance encounter. For 2 favor points, the Narrator may allow a character to benefit from the effects of a 1st-level spell that aligns with a deity’s portfolio. Narrators are free to come up with other uses.</p>\n<p>If a character acts against the interests or philosophy of a deity during an adventure, any points of favor are immediately lost.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Table: Religious Devotion</strong></p>\n<table style=\"width: 100%;\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 16.6483%;\"><col style=\"width: 3.63837%;\"><col style=\"width: 7.60786%;\"><col style=\"width: 72.1055%;\"></colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Philosophical Similarity</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">DC</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Offering*</td>\n<td>Description</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Strongly Aligned</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">10 gp</td>\n<td>The character’s personal ethos and actions closely mirror the deity’s philosophy and teachings.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aligned</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">15</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">25 gp</td>\n<td>The character’s personal ethos and actions are<br>generally similar to the deity’s philosophy and teachings.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Neutral</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">20</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">50 gp</td>\n<td>The character’s personal ethos and actions do not align with or oppose the deity they are beseeching.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Opposed</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">25</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">100 gp</td>\n<td>The character’s personal ethos and actions are generally counter to the deity’s philosophy and teachings.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Strongly Opposed</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">30</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">500 gp</td>\n<td>The character’s personal ethos and actions run directly counter to the deity’s philosophy and teachings.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em>*The Narrator may allow specific actions by the character to reduce or eliminate this cost.</em></p>",
