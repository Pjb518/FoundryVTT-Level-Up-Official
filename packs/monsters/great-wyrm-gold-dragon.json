      "bio": "<h2><strong>COMBAT</strong></h2><p>While individual dragons have their own personalities and tactics, most rely heavily on their breath weapons. They use them whenever they can, preferably from maximum distance and while flying above their enemies.&nbsp;</p><p>When fighting in the open, dragons often circle above their enemies as they wait for their breath weapons to recharge. They only close to melee if their enemies deal significant damage with ranged attacks, or if they can savage an enemy cut off from its allies. Once bloodied, dragons become more aggressive, attacking with bite and claws when their breath weapons aren’t available.</p><p>If a dragon is protecting its lair, it utilizes lair features, traps, allies, and architecture such as escape tunnels to keep up a hit-and-run fight, reappearing only when it has a fully-recharged breath weapon. If the dragon is forced into melee combat, it uses its bite and claws against a single foe. If it has legendary actions like Roar and Wing Attack, it uses them to disperse its other enemies.</p><p>If reduced to less than one-fourth its hit points while fighting in the open, a dragon flies away. However, it fights to the death to defend its lair, unless it can regain the upper hand through tricks or bargains.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>GOLD DRAGON LAIR FEATURES</strong></h2><p>The save DC for the following effects is 13 + the dragon’s proficiency bonus. Choose or roll one or more of the following lair features:</p><p>1 An inner chamber in the dragon’s lair has large mirrors arranged on the walls. The dragon can use a legendary action while within reach of the wall to make a final adjustment, at which point every non-dragon creature in the lair makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is blinded while in the chamber. If any of the mirrors are shattered, the effect ends.</p><p>2 When a creature sees the dragon’s treasure for the first time, it makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it is charmed by the treasure. While charmed, it must use its movement to approach the pile and its action to take treasure. At the end of each of its turns and whenever it takes damage, the creature repeats the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p>3 Once per day, the dragon can use a legendary action to drink from a crucible of molten gold, recharging its breath weapon.</p><p>4 The dragon can use a bonus action to open a secret door to an escape tunnel. The dragon can make a claw attack on the tunnel to cause it to start collapsing. Creatures in the tunnel at the beginning of each of the dragon’s turns take 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage from falling debris.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>NAMES</strong></h2><p>Aurum the Bold, Glitterwing, Gordachel, Halcyon, Salgexica, Pontifarix&nbsp;</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>LEGENDS AND LORE</strong></h2><p>With an Arcana or History check, characters can learn the following:</p><p><strong>DC 10</strong> Gold dragons are the largest and most regal of the metallic dragons. Only red dragons rival their might.</p><p><strong>DC 15</strong> Though they are creatures of flesh and bone, a gold dragon’s scales are made of real gold. They breathe molten gold like a red dragon breathes fire.</p><p><strong>DC 20</strong> Gold dragons are powerful champions of good, but winning one’s support is a task fit for only the greatest of heroes.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></h2><p>Haughty and regal, gold dragons carry themselves with the swagger of a gallant knight. They are both indispensable allies and terrifying foes. Should they deem a cause righteous, they take to it with absolute zeal, whether or not that cause aligns with the concerns of short-lived folk.</p><p><strong><em>Aloof Hermits.</em></strong> Gold dragons greatly value their privacy. They know many humanoids regard them as god-like creatures capable of solving any problem. But as gold dragons learn from a young age, the more you help people, the more they need your help. Sooner or later, every side in every conflict petitions you for aid. Nasty business, says the dragon, who wants no part of it.</p><p><strong><em>Deep Hoards.</em></strong> Though their loyalty can’t be bought, gold dragons appreciate treasure as much as any dragon. They happily accept offerings of gold or jewels. In fact, gold dragons can eat such treasures for sustenance (they enjoy pearls and gems especially) but they have no need to gorge themselves, meaning their hoards tend to grow larger as they age.</p><p><strong><em>Guardian Vigil.</em></strong> Gold dragons maintain large territories, always keeping an eye out for extraplanar threats, tyranny in nearby nations, and the encroachment of red dragons. Gold dragons can be overzealous in their response to such threats, their righteous anger often causing unintended collateral damage.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>BEHAVIOR</strong></h2><p>1 On a mission against an evil monster</p><p>2 On a peak or other high ground, watching for trouble</p><p>3 Disguised as an animal, such as a dire wolf or other creature, which will befriend those in need</p><p>4 Drowsing on its treasure hoard</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>SIGNS</strong></h2><p>1 Clouds look like they’ve been shaped into sculptures</p><p>2 Whatever the time of year, trees are heavy with ripe fruit</p><p>3 Resident intelligent creatures are cheerful and unafraid of travelers</p><p>4 Distant spires and monuments</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>ENCOUNTERS</strong></h2><p>Gold dragons appreciate lairs with history, often making their homes in ancient ruins and old tombs.</p><p><strong>CR 3–4</strong> gold dragon wyrmling</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 300 gp, 10 antique weapons (25 gp each), 2 <em>potions of healing</em>, <em>bag of tricks</em> (rust)</p><p><strong>CR 5–10</strong> young gold dragon; gold dragon wyrmling with 2 or 3 awakened trees, azers, or druids</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 1,000 gp, gold bracelet shaped like twining roses (250 gp), 2 gold bracelets (75 gp each), 7 lapis lazuli gemstones (10 gp each), <em>ring of fire resistance</em>, <em>wind fan</em></p><p><strong>CR 11–16</strong> young gold dragon with 2 knights, pegasi, or priests</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 2,000 gp, 3 pearls (100 gp each), 2 gold ewers (750 gp each), 4 gold necklaces (250 gp each), <em>restorative ointment</em>, <em>adamantine chain shirt</em>, <em>luck blade scimitar</em></p><p><strong>CR 17–22</strong> adult gold dragon</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 10,000 gp, 2,000 ep, 4 aquamarine and topaz gemstones (500 gp each), gold noble’s coronet (2,500 gp), platinum-handled ceremonial greatsword (2,500 gp), bolt of cloth of gold (750 gp), 6 <em>+3 arrows</em>, 2 <em>potions of heroism</em>, <em>candle of invocation</em>, <em>figurine of wondrous power</em> (golden lions)</p><p><strong>CR 23–30</strong> ancient gold dragon; adult gold dragon with 2 couatls or gold dragon wyrmlings; adult gold dragon with 2d8 soldiers and high priest or holy knight</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 10,000 gp, 20,000 dragon scales of real gold (1 gp each), 8 pearls (100 gp each), 12 sapphires and emeralds (1,000 gp each), <em>potion of storm giant strength</em>, <em>cubic gate</em>, <em>staff of healing</em></p><p><strong>CR 31+</strong> gold great wyrm; ancient gold dragon with archmage, deva, holy knight, or knight captain</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 3,000 pp, 90,000 gp, 10 diamonds and rubies (5,000 gp each), gold and ruby crown (25,000 gp each), <em>spell scrolls</em> of <em>mass heal</em> and <em>true resurrection</em>, <em>holy avenger greatsword</em>, <em>mantle of spell resistance</em></p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>MONSTER TYPE DESCRIPTION</strong></h2><p>Dragons include red and gold dragons, which are huge reptilian fire-breathers that number among the world’s most dangerous monsters. This type includes white dragons, which breathe killing frost, as well as smaller reptilian creatures related to true dragons, such as pseudodragons.&nbsp;</p>",
