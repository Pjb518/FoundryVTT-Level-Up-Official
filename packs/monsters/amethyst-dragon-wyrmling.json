      "bio": "<h2><strong>COMBAT</strong></h2><p></p><p>While individual dragons have their own personalities and tactics, most rely heavily on their breath weapons. They use them whenever they can, preferably from maximum distance and while flying above their enemies.&nbsp;</p><p>When fighting in the open, dragons often circle above their enemies as they wait for their breath weapons to recharge. They only close to melee if their enemies deal significant damage with ranged attacks, or if they can savage an enemy cut off from its allies. Once bloodied, dragons become more aggressive, attacking with bite and claws when their breath weapons aren\u2019t available.</p><p>If a dragon is protecting its lair, it utilizes lair features, traps, allies, and architecture such as escape tunnels to keep up a hit-and-run fight, reappearing only when it has a fully-recharged breath weapon. If the dragon is forced into melee combat, it uses its bite and claws against a single foe. If it has legendary actions like Roar and Wing Attack, it uses them to disperse its other enemies.</p><p>If reduced to less than one-fourth its hit points while fighting in the open, a dragon flies away. However, it fights to the death to defend its lair, unless it can regain the upper hand through tricks or bargains.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>AMETHYST DRAGON LAIR FEATURES</strong></h2><p>The save DC for the following effects is 13 + the dragon\u2019s proficiency bonus. Choose or roll one or more of the following lair features:</p><p>1 The lair hosts many charmed or willing servants. Once per day when the dragon would use Charm, it can summon 3 cult fanatics instead. Creatures summoned in this way fight until killed or until the dragon dismisses them as a bonus action.&nbsp;</p><p>2 Psionic illusions mask several passages through the lair. Spotting these illusions requires a successful Perception check against the lair\u2019s DC. Physically interacting with an illusion also reveals its nature.</p><p>3 The lair resonates with the dragon\u2019s psionic powers. The range of the dragon\u2019s psionic abilities is doubled.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>4 The dragon\u2019s words seem to ring true amidst the opulence and grandeur of its lair. Insight checks made to determine the dragon\u2019s true intentions have disadvantage.&nbsp;</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>NAMES</strong></h2><p>Ath Sathna, Berthelos, Emerensa, Pancharatnam, Parana Vol, Skiveneth</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>LEGENDS AND LORE</strong></h2><p>With an Arcana or History check, characters can learn the following:</p><p><strong>DC 15</strong> Like all gem dragons, psionic dragons boast powerful psionic abilities. They can communicate telepathically and exhale powerful blasts of telekinetic force.</p><p><strong>DC 20</strong> Ancient amethyst dragons can control the weak-willed using the power of their minds alone.</p><p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></p><p>Though still reclusive by draconic standards, amethyst dragons are the most diplomatic of the gem dragons. They favor nonviolent negotiations, but even deals they make in good faith seem to end in their favor. They make their lairs welcoming to humanoid guests and are always eager to resolve a conflict with words before resorting to talons or the earth-shattering force of their breath weapons.</p><p><strong><em>Master Manipulators.</em></strong> To meet an amethyst dragon is to become its puppet. The moment it becomes aware of a creature, the dragon is already plotting to thwart the creature\u2019s plans or claim it as a pawn. An amethyst dragon\u2019s only saving grace is its lack of malice. Rarely does an amethyst dragon kill its foes outright, considering such violence a needless waste of resources. Instead, it seeks to turn each situation to its advantage\u2014and occasionally to the advantage of its allies as well. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>BEHAVIOR</strong></p><p>1 Dormant, telepathically viewing faraway events; angry if interrupted</p><p>2 Telepathically viewing the characters; wakes when they approach, offering knowledge</p><p>3 Allied with the characters\u2019 enemies; attacks or offers false friendship</p><p>4 Gathering allies against a cosmic threat</p><p><strong>SIGNS</strong></p><p>1 A telepathic greeting</p><p>2 Quartz crystals protrude from ground and rock</p><p>3 Local humanoids speak of a mighty friend who protects them</p><p>4 Local humanoids greet travelers by name</p><p><strong>ENCOUNTERS</strong></p><p>Amethyst dragons make their lairs near places where aberrant creatures find their way to the Material Plane.</p><p><strong>CR 3\u20134</strong> amethyst dragon wyrmling</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 100 gp, 300 ep, 10 quartz gemstones (20 gp each), <em>potion of greater healing</em></p><p><strong>CR 5\u201310</strong> young amethyst dragon; amethyst dragon wyrmling with 1d4 deep dwarf soldiers, dragonbound warriors (see warrior), or grimlock technicals</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 500 gp, 6 statues (75 gp each), 3 rare books (250 gp each), lead and quartz crown (250 gp) that prevents the wearer\u2019s thoughts from being read, <em>oil of etherealness</em></p><p><strong>CR 11\u201316</strong> young amethyst dragon with 2 gargoyles, gibbering mouthers, or spies (see cutthroat)</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 1,000 gp, 25 amethysts (100 gp each), adamantine greataxe (500 gp), <em>berserker axe</em></p><p><strong>CR 17\u201322</strong> adult amethyst dragon</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 5,000 gp, 50 amethysts (100 gp each), 40 rare books (250 gp each), 2 <em>potions of invisibility</em>, <em>spell scroll</em> of <em>scrying</em>, <em>robe of the archmagi</em></p><p><strong>CR 23\u201330</strong> ancient amethyst dragon; adult amethyst dragon with assassin, chuul, xorn, or young amethyst dragon</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 10,000 gp, 20 gold place settings (500 gp each), 20 rare books (250 gp each), 3 journals filled with precious secrets (10,000 gp each), 3 brains in vats (each is alive and can communicate telepathically), glowing pool (acts as 3 doses of <em>potion of supreme healing</em>), <em>rod of rulership</em></p><p><strong>CR 31+</strong> ancient amethyst dragon with rakshasa, salamander noble, or vampire mage</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 50,000 gp, 3 6-inch-diameter amethysts (10,000 gp each), 10 pieces of royal jewelry (7,500 gp each), maps of 100 royal palaces, <em>potion of supreme healing,</em> <em>helm of teleportation</em>, <em>staff of striking</em></p><p><strong>MONSTER TYPE DESCRIPTION</strong></p><p></p><p>Dragons include red and gold dragons, which are huge reptilian fire-breathers that number among the world\u2019s most dangerous monsters.
