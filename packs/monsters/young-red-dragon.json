      "bio": "<h2>Combat</h2><p>While individual dragons have their own personalities and tactics, most rely heavily on their breath weapons. They use them whenever they can, preferably from maximum distance and while flying above their enemies.&nbsp;</p><p>When fighting in the open, dragons often circle above their enemies as they wait for their breath weapons to recharge. They only close to melee if their enemies deal significant damage with ranged attacks, or if they can savage an enemy cut off from its allies. Once bloodied, dragons become more aggressive, attacking with bite and claws when their breath weapons aren\u2019t available.</p><p>If a dragon is protecting its lair, it utilizes lair features, traps, allies, and architecture such as escape tunnels to keep up a hit-and-run fight, reappearing only when it has a fully-recharged breath weapon. If the dragon is forced into melee combat, it uses its bite and claws against a single foe. If it has legendary actions like Roar and Wing Attack, it uses them to disperse its other enemies.</p><p>If reduced to less than one-fourth its hit points while fighting in the open, a dragon flies away. However, it fights to the death to defend its lair, unless it can regain the upper hand through tricks or bargains.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Red Dragon Lair Features</h2><p>The save DC for the following effects is 13 + the dragon\u2019s proficiency bonus. Choose or roll one or more of the following lair features:</p><p>1 Volcanic vents spew dark clouds of smoke, heavily obscuring a 20-foot-radius area. When a breathing creature starts its turn in the cloud or enters it for the first time on a turn, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the start of its next turn.</p><p>2 If the dragon makes a tail attack against the lair\u2019s wall, a large stalactite falls down from the ceiling, striking a 10-foot-square area of the dragon\u2019s choice. Each creature in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage and becoming restrained on a failure. A creature can use its action to make an Acrobatics or Athletics check against the lair\u2019s save DC, freeing itself or another creature on a success. If the dragon uses this ability more than three times in a day, the cavern starts collapsing.</p><p>3 Pools of lava are scattered throughout the lair. The dragon can use a legendary action to drink from a pool. Until the end of its next turn, its Searing Heat feature deals double damage.</p><p>4 The air in the dragon\u2019s lair is dangerously hot. On first entering the lair and every hour thereafter, a creature without fire resistance or immunity makes a Constitution saving throw, gaining a level of fatigue on a failure.&nbsp;</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Names</h2><p>Alerathax, Elderfire, Emberwing, Ithildrun, Pyrash, Verpyrion&nbsp;</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Legends and Lore</h2><p>With an Arcana or History check, characters can learn the following:</p><p><strong>DC 10</strong> Red dragons are creatures of flame and greed. They live inside volcanoes and hoard wealth unimaginable by even the richest monarch.</p><p><strong>DC 15</strong> Steaming vents and pools of bubbling magma fill a red dragon\u2019s lair.</p><p><strong>DC 20</strong> The oldest red dragons are often served by minions from the Plane of Fire, such as fire elementals, magmins, or salamanders. The dragon rules over these minions like a mortal tyrant.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Description</h2><p>The most arrogant of all dragons, red dragons believe themselves the rulers of dragons and lesser creatures alike. They brook no disobedience and incinerate any who dare oppose them.</p><p><strong><em>Rulers of the World</em>.</strong> Red dragons believe their might is unsurpassed by mortal creatures. The very existence of gold dragons, their closest rivals, enrages them, causing them to attack gold dragons on sight. All other creatures must either serve them or be eaten.</p><p>Red dragons make their lairs atop the highest mountain peaks, where they can look down upon their domains. They consider everything within sight to be their property, and the sky their domain alone. They keep a watchful eye for rival dragons or other flying creatures, which must be driven to the earth or destroyed.</p><p>Among themselves, red dragons are hierarchical. They grudgingly accept the dominance of larger dragons, and demand fealty from smaller ones. Two red dragons of similar age will clash until one crawls away, its wings torn and its hoard plundered.</p><p><strong><em>Treasure Hoarders</em>.</strong> Red dragons are greedy even by draconic standards. They believe every gemstone and scrap of precious metal belongs in their lair. To red dragons, no tribute is too great, and the crime of holding back wealth is a capital one.</p><p><strong><em>Fiery Infernos</em>. </strong>A red dragon\u2019s peak inevitably becomes volcanically active. Inside its cavernous lair, the dragon may sleep on an island surrounded by magma or ride updrafts of sulphurous gases. When a red dragon becomes enraged, the volcano erupts.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Behavior</h2><p>1\u20132 Attacks on sight</p><p>2 Drowsing atop its treasure</p><p>3 Feeding on a gargantuan monster corpse</p><p>4 Raging and threatening terrified captives</p><p>5 Flying overhead</p><p>6 Attacking a settlement</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Signs</h2><p>1 The smell of sulfur</p><p>2 A tremor shakes the ground</p><p>3 The air is almost unbearably hot</p><p>4 Three of the dragon\u2019s minions run by, fleeing from its murderous wrath</p><p>5 A raging fire</p><p>6 A distant explosion of lava</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Encounters</h2><p>Red dragons live atop volcanic mountain peaks.</p><p><strong>CR 5\u201310</strong> red dragon wyrmling with 1d6 + 2 dragonbound warriors (see warrior), kobolds, magmins, or warhordling orc warriors (see warrior)</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 1,800 gp, 2,000 sp, charred wagon filled with 400 gp of trade goods, 3 <em>potions of greater healing</em>, <em>handy haversack</em>, <em>+1 shield</em> (embossed with a gold dragon head)</p><p><strong>CR 11\u201316</strong> young red dragon; young red dragon with 1d8 + 4 dragonbound warriors (see warrior), kobolds, or soldiers; young red dragon with 2 dragon cultists, gargoyles, or ogres</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 2,500 gp, 10,000 sp, 3 garnets (100 gp each), gold dragon idol (750 gp), 2 <em>potions of superior healing</em>, <em>necklace of fireballs</em>, <em>staff of the magi</em></p><p><strong>CR 17\u201322</strong> adult red dragon; adult red dragon with flame-spitting statue (see walking statue) or half-red dragon veteran</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 11,000 gp, 8,000 sp, ceremonial gold sword (250 gp), 3 gold ewers (750 gp each), pearl necklace (2,500 gp), 2 <em>oils of sharpness</em>, 3 <em>potions of flying</em>, <em>+1 scale armor</em>, <em>staff of striking</em></p><p><strong>CR 23\u201330</strong> ancient red dragon; adult red dragon with fire elemental or xorn</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 2,000 pp, 20,000 gp, 3 rubies (5,000 gp each), 15 marble busts of human rulers (1,000 gp each), 3 <em>potions of storm giant strength</em>, <em>potion of supreme healing</em>, <em>wand of fireballs</em>, <em>luck blade</em></p><p><strong>CR 31+</strong> red great wyrm; ancient red dragon with cyclops, efreeti, fire giant, or young red dragon; ancient red dragon with 3 fire elementals, salamanders, or wyverns</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 5,000 pp, 100,000 gp, 10 miscellaneous pieces of royal jewelry (2,500 gp each), book of sigil sequences fo 6 teleportation circles, magical anvil (any armor forged on it grants fire resistance), 3 <em>potions of supreme healing</em>, <em>arrow of dragon slaying</em>, <em>potion of diminution</em>, 2 <em>splint armors of fire resistance</em>, <em>ring of fire elementals</em></p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Monster Type Description</h2><p>Dragons include red and gold dragons, which are huge reptilian fire-breathers that number among the world\u2019s most dangerous monsters.
