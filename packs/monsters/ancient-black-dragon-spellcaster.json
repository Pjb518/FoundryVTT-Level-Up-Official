      "bio": "<h2>Combat</h2><p>While individual dragons have their own personalities and tactics, most rely heavily on their breath weapons. They use them whenever they can, preferably from maximum distance and while flying above their enemies.&nbsp;</p><p>When fighting in the open, dragons often circle above their enemies as they wait for their breath weapons to recharge. They only close to melee if their enemies deal significant damage with ranged attacks, or if they can savage an enemy cut off from its allies. Once bloodied, dragons become more aggressive, attacking with bite and claws when their breath weapons aren\u2019t available.</p><p>If a dragon is protecting its lair, it utilizes lair features, traps, allies, and architecture such as escape tunnels to keep up a hit-and-run fight, reappearing only when it has a fully-recharged breath weapon. If the dragon is forced into melee combat, it uses its bite and claws against a single foe. If it has legendary actions like Roar and Wing Attack, it uses them to disperse its other enemies.</p><p>If reduced to less than one-fourth its hit points while fighting in the open, a dragon flies away. However, it fights to the death to defend its lair, unless it can regain the upper hand through tricks or bargains.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Black Dragon Lair Features</h2><p>The save DC for the following effects is 13 + the dragon\u2019s proficiency bonus. Choose or roll one or more of the following lair features:</p><p>1 A successful Perception check reveals a hidden tunnel. If possible, the dragon snaps someone up in its jaws and squeezes through the tunnel.</p><p>2 The lair contains craters filled with bubbling acid. Once per turn, the dragon can use a legendary action to dunk a grappled creature into the acid. The creature takes acid damage equal to one-half the dragon\u2019s breath weapon damage.</p><p>3 Murky pools connect to the surrounding bog via underwater tunnels.&nbsp;</p><p>4 Creatures other than the black dragon gain no benefit from darkvision within the lair. The dragon can make a creature immune to this effect by ritualistically scarring it with acid.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Names</h2><p>Algarath, Azoth, Ebonflame, Exatharis, Bitterbite, Sear</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Legends and Lore</h2><p>With an Arcana or History check, characters can learn the following:</p><p><strong>DC 10</strong> Black dragons make their lairs in swamps and among the ruins of ancient empires.</p><p><strong>DC 15</strong> Black dragons spit acid, and the oldest among them can surround themselves with magical darkness.</p><p><strong>DC 20</strong> Obsessed with death, black dragons sometimes extend their existences through an arcane ritual that turns them into liches.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Description</h2><p>With a death's-head face and black wings like a tattered cloak, a black dragon somewhat resembles the humanoid personification of death. Dwelling in rotting swamps among fallen and forgotten monuments, a black dragon revels in terror and decay.</p><p><strong><em>Cruel Ambushers</em>.</strong> Black dragons are equally at home high in the night sky or hiding beneath the murky waters of their swamp lairs. They can surround themselves with magical pools of inky shadow. With many ways to hide from prey, black dragons are deadly ambush hunters. Most black dragons relish the fear of their quarry and draw out their hunts as long as possible. Sometimes they grant wounded prey temporary respite, allowing the illusion of escape before plunging their quarry into darkness and terror.</p><p><strong><em>Ancient Monuments</em>.</strong> Black dragons are both attracted to\u2014and the cause of\u2014decay and ruin. They often lair within the palaces of fallen kingdoms, especially those they helped topple. But even long-buried peoples still seem alive to the black dragon. It holds ancient rivals in a mixture of contempt and reverence, and often gloats over the dead it has drowned. Collectors and students of ancient relics and treasure, black dragons are eager to share their knowledge about ancient mysteries\u2014though the questioner may not long survive the answer.</p><p><strong><em>Life Beyond Death.</em></strong> With their fixation on time and mortality, black dragons are the most common dragon liches. If personal undeath is beyond a black dragon\u2019s arcane power, it may seek to bolster its physical defenses by creating armies of undead servants.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Behavior</h2><ol><li><p>Sleeping underwater</p></li><li><p>Ranting about the weaklings it has destroyed</p></li><li><p>Hiding in ambush</p></li><li><p>Vandalizing ancient architecture</p></li><li><p>Hiding a portion of its treasure in a secondary lair, just in case; it tries to destroy witnesses</p></li><li><p>Flying overhead, hunting</p></li></ol><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Signs</h2><p> 1. Sucking mire; after each hour of travel, succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or gain a level of fatigue<br> 2. Fouled, poisoned water.<br> 3. Low mist obscuring dangerous bogs and other hazards<br> 4. A draconic footprint filled with steaming liquid<br> 5.
