      "bio": "<h2><strong>COMBAT</strong></h2><p>The khalkos starts combat by using Chaos Pheromones on clusters of enemies, and then uses Psionic Sting on either a creature with an alignment or a creature likely to fail an Intelligence saving throw. Once an enemy is stunned, the khalkos uses Brain Jab. The khalkos retreats once it has infected a target with brain larvae (possibly using <em>plane shift</em> if it hasn\u2019t already today).</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>DISEASE: BRAIN LARVAE</strong></h2><p>A khalkos can infect an intelligent creature with a horrifying disease, injecting khalkos larvae directly into the creature\u2019s skull. While infected with this disease, the host undergoes the following changes:</p><p><strong><em>Telepathy.</em></strong> The host gains telepathy out to a radius of 120 feet. Additionally, the host can telepathically communicate with the khalkos that infected it over any distance, as long as they are on the same plane.</p><p><strong><em>Trust.</em></strong> Whenever a khalkos makes a Charisma check to convince the host of its good intentions, it does so with advantage. If it succeeds, the host becomes friendly to it no matter its previous attitude.&nbsp;</p><p>After 10 (3d6) days, the host develops a splitting headache and is incapacitated for 24 hours. At the end of this time, the host dies. If the host has an alignment trait, 2 or 3 khalkos spawn burst out of the host\u2019s skull after 1 round.</p><p><em>Greater restoration</em> or a similar spell cast with at least a 5th-level spell slot is required to kill the brain larvae and remove the disease.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>LEGENDS AND LORE</strong></h2><p>With an Arcana or Religion check, characters can learn the following:</p><p><strong>DC 15</strong> An ancient book, purportedly written by a refugee from another reality, describes a species of intelligent, wasp-like creatures that parasitically prey on angels and other planar beings.</p><p><strong>DC 20</strong> A khalkos is a wasp-like aberration. It exudes a cloud of pheromones that maddens everyone nearby, and it implants creatures with skull-exploding larvae.</p><p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></p><p>Khalkoi, more commonly known as mind wasps, are parasitic predators that feed on the cosmic principles of good and evil, law and chaos. They conquer reality after reality, leaving behind deserted heavens and dead gods as they rob worlds of divine magic.</p><p>A khalkos is humanoid in shape with an inexpressive wasp face. It is able to disguise itself psionically in order to infiltrate sacred or profane places, dooming them to destruction.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Parasitic Life Cycle.</em></strong> Adult khalkoi implant their larvae into the brains of intelligent creatures. A parasitized victim comes to see every khalkos as an ally to be trusted, and may even help a khalkos implant its eggs in other victims. When khalkos larvae are ready to be born, they burst from the skull of their host. As the headless victim collapses to the ground, the khalkos larvae\u2014now independent khalkos spawn\u2014fly away to search for new victims.</p><p>&nbsp;Although khalkos larvae can infect any intelligent creature, they prefer hosts that are cosmically aligned: archpriests and saints, angels and devils, and even gods. Only in such hosts can khalkos larvae consume the divine magic they need to perpetuate their horrific life cycle. Khalkos spawned from an aligned creature begin growing into adult khalkoi immediately, reaching maturity in a few days. Khalkos that hatch from unaligned creatures must consume many humanoid creatures, over a period of months or years, before they mature.</p><p><strong><em>Existential Threat.</em></strong> A khalkos can sense cosmic power as a spider senses a tremor in its webs. The battles of warring pantheons, or mighty deeds performed by celestial or fiendish champions, can attract their attention to a heretofore-overlooked planar realm.</p><p>Usually, only a single khalkos travels to a newly discovered world. With mastermind intelligence and mind-clouding psionic powers, it infiltrates a temple or cult. Finally, it targets a divinely-empowered priest or minor fiend, hijacking its body to serve as the breeding ground for its eggs. Soon, one khalkos becomes a swarm of khalkoi that immediately set their sights on bigger game.</p><p><strong><em>Fight or Flight.</em></strong> A few worlds have successfully fought off a khalkos invasion. To win such a war, powerful cosmic entities must be aided by unaligned heroes: warriors, spellcasters, and other adventurers who don\u2019t inherit their power from cosmic principles but who are willing to fight for them nonetheless.&nbsp;</p><p>Other worlds have survived the khalkos threat by avoiding detection. Some dimensions have constructed vast psychic barriers or concluded divine treaties to limit the power of deities and fiends. If these magical protections are violated, such worlds risk unwelcome attention.</p><p><strong>BEHAVIOR</strong></p><p>1 Using <em>alter self</em> to infiltrate a group as a low-ranking member</p><p>2 Using <em>alter self</em> to infiltrate a group, taking the form of a high-ranking member that it has killed</p><p>3 Attacking, determined to infect a certain person with khalkos larvae</p><p>4 Using <em>alter self</em> and asking questions about local groups</p><p>5 Ritually casting <em>teleportation circle</em> as part of a year-long effort to make a permanent circle</p><p>6 Scouting for a larger group; has big plans and wants to eliminate anyone who could upset them</p><p><strong>SIGNS</strong></p><p>1-2 A corpse in a pool of blood, its head exploded</p><p>3-4 People acting strangely, insisting that you visit a friend of theirs who will make everything clear</p><p>5 What appears to be a dead, foot-long wasp</p><p>6 A faint, intoxicating scent in the air</p><p><strong>ENCOUNTERS</strong></p><p>Khalkoi haven\u2019t discovered our reality yet. If they do, they will probably target Hell, the Abyss, or the planar realm of a god, or perhaps infiltrate a religious organization on the Material Plane.</p><p><strong>CR 5\u201310</strong> khalkos; 3 to 5 khalkos spawn; 2 swarms of khalkos spawn</p><p><strong>CR 11\u201316</strong> khalkos with parasitized cambion, couatl, high priest, or unicorn; khalkos with 2 parasitized bearded devils or priests</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 6 <em>beads of force</em></p><p><strong>CR 17\u201322</strong> 2 khalkoi; khalkos with 4 to 6 khalkos spawn</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> strangely proportioned black metal helm (acts as <em>crystal ball</em> when worn), <em>cubic gate</em></p>",
