      "bio": "<p>(Elite Version, 2x XP)</p><h2><strong>COMBAT</strong></h2><p>The demilich stays immobile unless intruders take actions that threaten it or its treasure hoard. It then flies into the air, taking care to stay at least 50 feet above enemies. It uses Devour Soul on each of its turns, targeting its biggest threat. It uses Telekinesis and Ringing Laugh when it\u2019s able to do so from a distance. If creatures are within 30 feet of it, it uses Dust Storm and tries to move away. When reduced to 40 hit points or fewer, it uses Cranial Transposition to swap places with a decoy skull (if one is available) to give the impression that it has been defeated. It will not willingly leave its lair.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>LEGENDS AND LORE</strong></h2><p>With an Arcana or Religion check, characters can learn the following:</p><p><strong>DC 15</strong> A demilich is what remains of a lich after all but the skull has crumbled to dust. It has forgotten its spells but is still dangerous.</p><p><strong>DC 20</strong> A demilich can trap a creature\u2019s soul in a gem set on its skull. Destroying the gem is the only way to rescue the trapped creature.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>DEMILICH LAIR FEATURES&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Each demilich carefully prepares its tomb to ward off or trap intruders. Choose or roll one or more of the following lair features for the chamber containing the demilich:</p><p>1 The first time on a creature\u2019s turn that it moves at least 5 feet without flying, it disturbs the yellow mold that covers every surface.&nbsp;</p><p>2 Whenever a creature other than the demilich tries to use a teleportation or planar travel effect, the effect fails, and the creature takes 22 (4d10) force damage.</p><p>3 The lair is crammed with traps of every type. If a character ends its turn without having moved, it is targeted by a trap. The trap has a +10 attack bonus and deals 10 (3d6) damage. Roll a d6 to determine the trap\u2019s nature and damage type: 1 dart trap (poison), 2 swinging blade (slashing), 3 crossbow bolt (piercing), 4 electrified surface (lightning), 5 gout of flame (fire), 6 collapsing ceiling segment (bludgeoning, and the creature\u2019s space becomes difficult terrain).</p><p>4 Heaps of skulls set with false gems make the floor difficult terrain. The demilich can Hide among the skulls as a bonus action.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>SINISTER RIDDLES IN A DEMILICH DUNGEON</strong></h2><p>1 \"We build castles and hold up the sea. We measure your days of mortality.\" (Sand)</p><p>2 \u201cThis house can be bought but the dweller won\u2019t pay. You hope and you pray that the dweller will stay.\u201d (coffin)</p><p>3 \u201cThe thief evades the watchman's eye, the guard dog's nose, the lich's curse. He finds the treasure, picks the lock, but he is killed by a part reversed. What killed the thief?\" (trap)</p><p>4 \u201cBy the window all night weeping, with each tear your life goes seeping. Wax as you wane! What are you? Explain!\u201d (candle)</p><p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></p><p>While a lich\u2019s unnatural semblance of life can last for millennia, the passing centuries blunt its ambitions and crumble its bones to dust. A demilich is what remains when a lich\u2019s body and spirit have all but decomposed, leaving behind only a gem-encrusted skull and perhaps a few bone shards. The demilich lies dormant and dreams of past glories or arcane mysteries. Only an immediate threat against itself or its treasure hoard can rouse it to unleash the arcane energies it once mastered.</p><p><strong><em>Swirling Dust.</em></strong> When a demilich isn\u2019t active, it is indistinguishable from an inanimate gemmed skull lying amidst bone powder. When it moves or attacks, the dust of its former body swirls around it in a wraithlike form that gestures as if casting spells.</p><p><strong><em>Soul Gems and Warding Gems.</em></strong> An ancient lich can extend its unnatural lifespan by binding its soul to one or two flawless gems set in its skull, usually in its eye sockets. When a jeweled lich\u2019s bones finally molder past recognition, these soul gems preserve its skull and prevent its soul from passing on.&nbsp;</p><p>The demilich can use these gems to trap and devour the souls of those who interrupt its repose. Each devoured soul increases the demilich\u2019s power and prolongs its existence. A soul gem looted from a defeated demilich can be sold for 10,000 gp or more.</p><p>A demilich\u2019s skull is often set with up to five smaller gems, often on its forehead or teeth. These gems are warded to protect the demilich against enemy spells. Each warding gem is worth 1,000 gp.</p><p><strong><em>Soul Vessel.</em></strong> The demilich preserves the soul vessel it used as a lich\u2014usually a small item such as a box or amulet. If the demilich is destroyed while its soul vessel survives, the demilich reforms around the vessel in 1d10 days. A demilich can be permanently defeated only by destroying its soul vessel.</p><p><strong><em>Trapped Lair.</em></strong> Demiliches take great care to protect their final resting place. The approach to a demilich\u2019s lair is laden with traps and patrolled by undead and construct guards. Riddles guide explorers to (or away from) the demilich\u2019s innermost sanctum. Their lairs are often warded against teleportation and planar travel. Many demiliches fill their lairs with decoy skulls plastered with impressive-looking (but worthless) jewels.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SIGNS</strong></p><p>1 A trapdoor in a tomb, ziggurat, or barrow</p><p>2 A door set in the mouth of a giant skull</p><p>3 A cryptic message etched into a wall, such as \u201cEndless Life through the Doors of Death\u201d</p><p>4 A riddle indicating which object contains a key to a magically locked door</p><p><strong>ENCOUNTERS</strong></p><p>Demiliches are found in well-hidden lairs in any environment.</p><p><strong>CR 17\u201322</strong> demilich</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 2 gems set in skull (10,000 gp each), 40 inanimate skeletons with gemmed eyes (80 gems worth 50 gp each), <em>mirror of life trapping </em>(used as one of the lair\u2019s defenses), <em>+1 plate armor </em>with a golden gauntlet (while attuned to the armor, the wearer can cast <em>cure wounds</em> at 3rd-level, 1/day)</p><p><strong>CR 23\u201330</strong> demilich with stone golem; demilich with 2 or 3 skeletal guardians; demilich with 1 or 2 elementals</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 2 gems set in skull (10,000 gp each), 500 pp, 2,300 gp, <em>spell scroll</em> of <em>plane shift</em>, <em>spell scroll</em> of <em>maze</em>, <em>sphere of annihilation</em> (used as one of the lair\u2019s defenses)</p><p><strong>CR 31\u201340</strong> Skull of Medon</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 4 gems set in skull (50,000 gp each), <em>Ioun stone of greater absorption</em></p><p><strong>MONSTER TYPE DESCRIPTION</strong></p><p></p><p>Undead are supernatural creatures or spirits that are no longer alive but are still animate.
