      "bio": "<h2><strong>COMBAT</strong></h2><p>While individual dragons have their own personalities and tactics, most rely heavily on their breath weapons. They use them whenever they can, preferably from maximum distance and while flying above their enemies.&nbsp;</p><p>When fighting in the open, dragons often circle above their enemies as they wait for their breath weapons to recharge. They only close to melee if their enemies deal significant damage with ranged attacks, or if they can savage an enemy cut off from its allies. Once bloodied, dragons become more aggressive, attacking with bite and claws when their breath weapons aren\u2019t available.</p><p>If a dragon is protecting its lair, it utilizes lair features, traps, allies, and architecture such as escape tunnels to keep up a hit-and-run fight, reappearing only when it has a fully-recharged breath weapon. If the dragon is forced into melee combat, it uses its bite and claws against a single foe. If it has legendary actions like Roar and Wing Attack, it uses them to disperse its other enemies.</p><p>If reduced to less than one-fourth its hit points while fighting in the open, a dragon flies away. However, it fights to the death to defend its lair, unless it can regain the upper hand through tricks or bargains.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>SHADOW DRAGON LAIR FEATURES</strong></h2><p>Choose or roll one or more of the following lair features:</p><p>1 The dragon\u2019s lair is in a rotten quagmire. Roughly 90 percent of the lair is swampy difficult terrain.</p><p>2 The dragon\u2019s lair is infested with shambling undead. At the beginning of each round of combat, roll a d6. On a 3\u20136, 2d4 zombies arrive to defend the dragon, acting on the dragon\u2019s initiative. They fight until killed or until the dragon verbally instructs them to stop.&nbsp;</p><p>3 The dragon\u2019s lair is cloaked in perpetual twilight. While the shadow dragon is present, the dragon\u2019s lair can\u2019t be illuminated brighter than dim light, even through magical means.</p><p>4 &nbsp; The lair contains pools of black water. As a legendary action, the dragon can drink from a pool, regaining a number of hit points equal to its Constitution score.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>NAMES</strong></h2><p>Blightshadow, Guagamela, Peshawar, Quadisiya, Tar\u2019Ethias, Umbra.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>LEGENDS AND LORE</strong></h2><p>With an Arcana or History check, characters can learn the following:</p><p><strong>DC 10</strong> When their lands fall prey to blight, essence dragons grow sick and may transform into shadow dragons.</p><p><strong>DC 15</strong> As their name implies, shadow dragons are insubstantial, moving through solid objects with ease.</p><p><strong>DC 20</strong> Shadow dragons become more connected to shadow as they age. A truly ancient dragon can command darkness itself to fight on its behalf.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></h2><p>Shadow dragons inhabit places connected to shadowy realms, nations beset by constant war, and lands befouled by pollution and decay. They are neither conquerors nor despoilers. Rather, they are symptoms, signs that the soul of their land has succumbed to blight.</p><p><strong><em>Life of Death.</em> </strong>Shadow dragons begin as other essence dragons, but when their land is stricken with evil, they become insubstantial versions of their former selves. The shadow dragons of war-torn lands often bear countless open wounds; pollution and plague marks a dragon with gangrenous flesh and weeping sores; and dragons whose lands have become cursed appear gaunt and often fall into madness. Over time, a shadow dragon loses all traces of its former nature. It embraces its land\u2019s plight as its true essence, comes to resent its old life, and does whatever it can to maintain its land\u2019s suffering.</p><p><strong><em>Props and Propaganda. </em></strong>Many believe a shadow dragon\u2019s presence is an irrefutable sign of the land\u2019s failing health, using it as a justification for revolution. \u201cThe Dragon is Shadowed\u201d is a common rallying cry for change: a proclamation that the only answer to the status quo is a sudden\u2014and often bloody\u2014change of leadership.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>BEHAVIOR</strong></h2><p>1 Guarding its treasure, expecting visitors</p><p>2 Soaring overhead as it hunts</p><p>3 Receiving tribute from sickly-looking villagers</p><p>4 Watching invisibly from the shadows</p><p>5 Prowling near a magical light it longs to extinguish</p><p>6 Magically communicating with its master</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>SIGNS</strong></h2><p>1 The sky is overcast; mist cloaks the ground</p><p>2 Plants and trees are withered and twisted</p><p>3 Water and foraged food is poisonous</p><p>4 Firelight dims and shadows darken</p><p>5 Paranoid humanoids; afraid of (or members of) the dragon\u2019s secret police</p><p>6 Travelers\u2019 shadows menace their owners, or writhe as if in pain</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>ENCOUNTERS</strong></h2><p>Shadow dragons haunt accursed lands.</p><p><strong>CR 3\u20134</strong> shadow dragon wyrmling</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 300 ancient gold coins bearing a sinister symbol, garnet bracelet (250 gp), cursed black stone of uncertain powers</p><p><strong>CR 5\u201310</strong> young shadow dragon; shadow dragon wyrmling with 1d6 dragonbound warriors (see warrior), ghouls, or shadows</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 800 gp, 1,500 sp, 5 black metal weapons that trail black shadow (act as magic weapons; 200 gp each), <em>goggles of night</em>, <em>slippers of spider climbing</em></p><p><strong>CR 11\u201316</strong> young shadow dragon with banshee, black knight (see knight), or shadow demon</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 2,000 cursed gold coins (anyone carrying at least one has their Speed halved), 3 jet gemstones (100 gp each), gold demon idol (2,500 gp), 2 <em>potions of supreme healing</em>, <em>spell scroll</em> of <em>blight</em>,<em> talisman of ultimate evil</em></p><p><strong>CR 17\u201322</strong> adult shadow dragon</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 1,000 pp, 5,000 gp, 2 doses of wyvern poison (1,250 gp each), sinister black iron full plate armor (2,500 gp), <em>oil of etherealness</em>, <em>helm of brilliance</em></p><p><strong>CR 23\u201330</strong> ancient shadow dragon; adult shadow dragon with night hag, half-shadow dragon assassin, shadow elf high priest, or vampire</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 30,000 gp, 10 emeralds and sapphires (1,000 gp each), large emerald carved to look like a dragon\u2019s eye (5,000 gp), <em>arrow of celestial slaying</em>, <em>longsword of wounding</em>, <em>chain mail of fire resistance</em>, <em>broom of flying</em></p><p><strong>CR 31+</strong> ancient shadow dragon with archpriest or wraith lord; ancient shadow dragon with 2 or 3 ghosts, vampire spawn, or wraiths</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 100,000 gp, 100,000 tarnished silver coins, 5 rubies (5,000 gp each), 10 emeralds (1,000 gp each), twisted adamantium and diamond crown (25,000), ring bearing the seal of an order of paladins (250 gp), saddle sized for a dragon (10,000 gp), 2 <em>potions of supreme healing</em>, <em>holy avenger longsword</em>, <em>+1</em> <em>full plate armor</em>, <em>helm of telepathy</em></p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>MONSTER TYPE DESCRIPTION</strong></h2><p>Dragons include red and gold dragons, which are huge reptilian fire-breathers that number among the world\u2019s most dangerous monsters.
