      "bio": "<h2>Combat</h2><p>While individual dragons have their own personalities and tactics, most rely heavily on their breath weapons. They use them whenever they can, preferably from maximum distance and while flying above their enemies.&nbsp;</p><p>When fighting in the open, dragons often circle above their enemies as they wait for their breath weapons to recharge. They only close to melee if their enemies deal significant damage with ranged attacks, or if they can savage an enemy cut off from its allies. Once bloodied, dragons become more aggressive, attacking with bite and claws when their breath weapons aren\u2019t available.</p><p>If a dragon is protecting its lair, it utilizes lair features, traps, allies, and architecture such as escape tunnels to keep up a hit-and-run fight, reappearing only when it has a fully-recharged breath weapon. If the dragon is forced into melee combat, it uses its bite and claws against a single foe. If it has legendary actions like Roar and Wing Attack, it uses them to disperse its other enemies.</p><p>If reduced to less than one-fourth its hit points while fighting in the open, a dragon flies away. However, it fights to the death to defend its lair, unless it can regain the upper hand through tricks or bargains.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>White Dragon Lair Features</h2><p>The save DC for the following effects is 13 + the dragon\u2019s proficiency bonus. Choose or roll one or more of the following lair features:</p><p>1 A dusting of snow conceals an iced-over underground lake. The dragon can use 5 feet of its movement to break a hole in the ice big enough for it to pass through. A creature submerged in the frigid water makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of its turn, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failure.</p><p>2 All floors are slippery ice. Anyone moving more than half their speed in a single turn makes a Dexterity saving throw or falls prone, ending their movement.</p><p>3 Up to three times per day as a legendary action, the dragon slams its tail against the wall, causing slabs of ice (and possibly useful treasure) to rain from the ceiling. Up to 2 creatures the dragon can see make Dexterity saving throws. On a failure, a creature takes 10 (3d6) damage and is knocked prone and restrained beneath an ice slab. A creature can use its action to make an Acrobatics or Athletics check against the lair\u2019s save DC, freeing itself or another creature on a success.</p><p>4 The ceiling is held up by four pillars of ice (objects with AC 16, 15 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to fire damage). If three pillars are destroyed, the ceiling caves in, dealing 17 (5d6) bludgeoning damage to each creature in the lair and opening a hole in the ceiling large enough for the dragon to fly through.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Names</h2><p>Frysning, Issedrath, Stillness, Verglas, Vilustiminen, Winterheart</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Legends and Lore</h2><p>With an Arcana or History check, characters can learn the following:</p><p><strong>DC 10</strong> White dragons rule the frozen wastelands at the edges of the world.</p><p><strong>DC 15</strong> A white dragon\u2019s lair is often found at the center of a raging winter storm.</p><p><strong>DC 20</strong> Truly ancient white dragons can surround themselves with magical storms of sleet and ice.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Description</h2><p>Although the smallest of chromatic dragons, white dragons are also the most vicious. They find the presence of other creatures loathsome and slay those who enter their frozen domain.</p><p><strong><em>Frozen Solitude</em>. </strong>White dragons gravitate toward the cold, deserted lands at the edges of the world. They enjoy the solitude and purity of their icy homes. Most white dragons consider any intrusion into their territory an affront. Quick to anger and careless of its own wounds, a white dragon\u2019s fury can drive off even larger dragons.</p><p>While white dragons prefer to be alone, they occasionally tolerate servants who remain quiet and stay out of sight. The dour frost giants and cowed kobolds that serve a white dragon know better than to call attention to themselves, especially when their master is hungry.</p><p><strong><em>Icy Fastness</em>.</strong> A white dragon\u2019s territory slowly transforms into a frozen wasteland and eventually becomes the eye of a permanent winter storm. The largest white dragons have ambitions to extend their realms further, freezing the entire world.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Behavior</h2><p>1 Lying in wait for a dragon rival</p><p>2 Summoning an ice storm</p><p>3 Camouflaged in a snowbank</p><p>4 Flying overhead, on the hunt</p><p>5 Attacking a tribe of humans or orcs</p><p>6 Preparing for a diplomatic visit from a local frost giant noble; planning treachery</p><p>7 In its lair, asleep under a thin coating of ice and snow</p><p>8 Having a destructive tantrum, cursing some enemy</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Signs</h2><p>1\u20132 Blinding snow</p><p>3 Frost giant or mammoth encased in ice</p><p>4 A glacier riddled with caverns</p><p>5 Freezing, waist-high fog</p><p>6 Towering ice pillars, each large enough for a dragon to perch on</p><p>7 A dangerous blizzard</p><p>8 A maze made of glittering ice walls</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Encounters</h2><p>White dragons live among snow and constant blizzards.</p><p><strong>CR 3\u20134</strong> white dragon wyrmling with 3 or 4 kobolds or warriors; 2 white dragon wyrmlings</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 300 gp, 1,000 sp, giant polar bear fur (75 gp), <em>potion of greater healing</em>, <em>circlet of blasting</em></p><p><strong>CR 5\u201310</strong> young white dragon; young white dragon with 2 ice mephits or mountain dwarf soldiers&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 1,300 gp, 2 silver ewers (250 gp each), unmelting snowball, <em>potion of greater healing</em>, 3 <em>potions of fire resistance</em>, <em>ring of warmth</em>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CR 11\u201316</strong> adult white dragon</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 300 pp, 600 gp, 11 amber gemstones (100 gp each), key made of ice, 3 <em>potions of superior healing</em>, <em>feather token </em>(anchor), <em>rod of absorption</em></p><p><strong>CR 17\u201322</strong> ancient white dragon</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 13,000 gp, 30 furs (100 gp each), silver dragontooth necklace (250 gp), 6 <em>+2 crossbow bolts</em>, <em>potion of invisibility</em>, <em>shortsword of sharpness</em></p><p><strong>CR 23\u201330</strong> ancient white dragon with frost giant, werebear, winter hag, or young white dragon; adult white dragon with cyclops, tundra chimera (see chimera), or young white dragon</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 20,000 gp, diamond (5,000 gp), white dragon egg (25,000 gp), 2 <em>potions of supreme healing</em>, <em>arrow of titan slaying</em>, <em>Ioun stone of mastery</em>, <em>adamantine plate armor</em></p><p><strong>CR 31+</strong> white great wyrm; 2 adult white dragons</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 5,000 pp, 40,000 gp, 60,000 ep, 5 diamonds (5,000 gp each), mithral warhorn (7,500 gp), ice statue with a huge ruby (25,000 gp) at the heart, <em>4 potions of supreme healing</em>, <em>boots of speed</em>, <em>+2 warhammer</em> (named <em>Tark-Elith</em>; made of unmelting ice; grants its wielder fire resistance), <em>ring of shooting stars.</em></p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Monster Type Description</h2><p>Dragons include red and gold dragons, which are huge reptilian fire-breathers that number among the world\u2019s most dangerous monsters. This type includes white dragons, which breathe killing frost, as well as smaller reptilian creatures related to true dragons, such as pseudodragons.&nbsp;</p><p></p>",
