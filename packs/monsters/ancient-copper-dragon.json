      "bio": "<h2><strong>COMBAT</strong></h2><p>While individual dragons have their own personalities and tactics, most rely heavily on their breath weapons. They use them whenever they can, preferably from maximum distance and while flying above their enemies.&nbsp;</p><p>When fighting in the open, dragons often circle above their enemies as they wait for their breath weapons to recharge. They only close to melee if their enemies deal significant damage with ranged attacks, or if they can savage an enemy cut off from its allies. Once bloodied, dragons become more aggressive, attacking with bite and claws when their breath weapons aren\u2019t available.</p><p>If a dragon is protecting its lair, it utilizes lair features, traps, allies, and architecture such as escape tunnels to keep up a hit-and-run fight, reappearing only when it has a fully-recharged breath weapon. If the dragon is forced into melee combat, it uses its bite and claws against a single foe. If it has legendary actions like Roar and Wing Attack, it uses them to disperse its other enemies.</p><p>If reduced to less than one-fourth its hit points while fighting in the open, a dragon flies away. However, it fights to the death to defend its lair, unless it can regain the upper hand through tricks or bargains.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>COPPER DRAGON LAIR FEATURES</strong></h2><p>The save DC for the following effects is 13 + the dragon\u2019s proficiency bonus. Choose or roll one or more of the following lair features:</p><p>1 Those who travel the winding mountain paths to the dragon\u2019s lair feel as though they\u2019re being watched, and the instinct is not unfounded. The animals of the mountain observe travellers and report back to the dragon, ensuring it is never surprised.</p><p>2 The dragon can use a legendary action to stomp the ground, causing a weak point to give way. A 10-foot-wide, 10-foot-deep, acid-filled sinkhole appears in a space within 60 feet. Creatures in the area make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, they can use their reaction to move up to half their speed. A creature that can\u2019t escape falls into the pit, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage and 11 (2d10) acid damage.</p><p>3 If the dragon covers the floor of its lair with its Slowing Breath, the affected area turns soft and muddy, becoming difficult terrain until the start of the dragon\u2019s next turn. A creature in the mud when it reverts to stone becomes stuck in the hardening mud. While stuck, the creature\u2019s Speed becomes 0. The creature can use an action to make an Athletics check, freeing itself on a success.</p><p>4 Illusory walls in the lair hide secret escape passages, which the dragon can easily collapse by focusing its Acid Breath.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>NAMES</strong></h2><p>Alabran, Ithris, Millivillix, Quenzitar, Tatynara, Twopenny</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>LEGENDS AND LORE</strong></h2><p>With an Arcana or History check, characters can learn the following:</p><p><strong>DC 10</strong> One must take care when dealing with a copper dragon. Though mostly harmless, they sometimes allow their pranks to get out of hand.</p><p><strong>DC 15</strong> Copper dragons live on mountaintops and similar areas. They exhale blasts of acid or clouds of toxic gas to hinder their foes.</p><p><strong>DC 20</strong> A copper dragon\u2019s magical abilities develop as it ages, allowing it to teleport, merge with stone, and create illusory duplicates of itself.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></h2><p>Playful and whimsical, copper dragons often involve themselves in the affairs of short-lived folk, though their contributions to history aren\u2019t always positive. While copper dragons aren\u2019t generally malevolent, they are incorrigible tricksters and rarely understand the difference between a joke and outright cruelty. Of all dragons, copper dragons are the ones most likely to live near humanoids, as they are always searching for new targets for their pranks.</p><p><strong><em>Flighty Urges.</em></strong> As they grow older, copper dragons exhibit all manner of unusual interests. They may yearn for a simpler life and use their shapeshifting to pass themselves off as a farmer or wanderer. They may decide they\u2019re interested in politics and start secretly advising a noble on how best to run a nation. They may tunnel under a wishing well and give life advice to anyone who tosses in a coin. The only consistent feature of these impulses is that they\u2019re short-lived. Inevitably, a copper grows bored of its exploits and abandons them, possibly leaving many people high and dry in the process.</p><p><strong><em>Friendly, If Troublesome.</em></strong> Despite their mischievous natures, copper dragons rarely mean to do harm. If made to understand the trouble they\u2019ve caused, they can usually be counted on to compensate their victims. Convincing a copper dragon to see the error of its ways, however,&nbsp; is rarely a simple task.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>BEHAVIOR</strong></h2><p>1 Listening to a minstrel companion or prisoner</p><p>2 Demands to exchange jokes and riddles</p><p>3 Loves lying and leading travelers astray</p><p>4 Thinks the party\u2019s antics are hilarious</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>SIGNS</strong></h2><p>1 Graffiti or caricatures carved into cliffs or monuments</p><p>2 A distant laugh</p><p>3 Sandaled footprints that disappear or turn into draconic prints</p><p>4 An angry local that has been tricked</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>ENCOUNTERS</strong></h2><p>Copper dragons make their lairs in high mountains and cliffs, where they can watch the consequences of their mischief play out from an elevated position.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CR 3\u20134</strong> copper dragon wyrmling</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 200 gp, 1,000 sp, loaded dice, deluxe disguise kit (100 gp), 3 <em>potions of healing </em>(turn the drinker green for 6 hours)</p><p><strong>CR 5\u201310</strong> young copper dragon; copper dragon wyrmling with 1d6 + 2 goblins, pixies, or pseudodragons</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 1,000 gp, 6 jade and jet gemstones (100 gp each), <em>potion of greater healing</em>, <em>ring of protection</em> (named <em>Joy Buzzer</em>; if the wearer can cast cantrips, <em>shocking grasp</em> is added to its list of known cantrips)</p><p><strong>CR 11\u201316</strong> young copper dragon with 1d4 + 1 faerie dragons, magmins, or rust monsters</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 1,500 gp, 5 pieces of gold jewelry (250 gp each), 10 rare joke books (125 gp each), 6 <em>potions of superior healing</em> (each also randomly applies the effects of <em>potions of growth</em> or <em>diminution</em>), <em>+3 chain mail</em></p><p><strong>CR 17\u201322</strong> adult copper dragon; adult copper dragon with fey knight, green hag, or minstrel&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 12,000 gp, 6 spinel and peridot gemstones (500 gp each), <em>spell scrolls</em> of <em>irresistible dance</em> and <em>time stop</em>, <em>rod of absorption</em></p><p><strong>CR 23\u201330</strong> ancient copper dragon; ancient copper dragon with 2 doppelgangers or trickster priests (see priest)</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 2,000 pp, 15,000 gp, printing press, 2,000 copies of self-published joke book, 2 <em>potions of supreme healing</em>, <em>mace of smiting</em> (looks like a jester\u2019s staff with a bell-tipped hat; its wielder can use an action to cast <em>disguise self </em>at will)</p><p><strong>CR 31+</strong> ancient copper dragon with archmage, invisible render (see invisible stalker), or young copper dragon</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 75,000 gp, 75,000 counterfeit gold-painted copper coins, 5 pieces of gold jewelry (125 gp each), 20 pieces of gold-plated jewelry (25 gp each), contraption that coats things with gold, spell scroll of <em>shapechange</em>, <em>adamantine half plate</em>, <em>iron flask</em></p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>MONSTER TYPE DESCRIPTION</strong></h2><p>Dragons include red and gold dragons, which are huge reptilian fire-breathers that number among the world\u2019s most dangerous monsters.
