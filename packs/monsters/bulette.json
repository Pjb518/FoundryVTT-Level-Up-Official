It fights to the death.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>LEGENDS AND LORE&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>With a Nature or Survival check, characters can learn the following:</p><p><strong>DC 10</strong> Bulettes are armor-plated predators that burst up from the ground.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>DC 15</strong> Bulettes love halflings and pursue them above other targets (note: this is DC 5 for halflings).</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></h2><p>A bulette, also called a land shark, is a voracious predator that tunnels underground, using tremorsense to search for prey.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Underground Hunters</em>.</strong> Bulettes burrow constantly, never sleeping and claiming no lair for their own. When they tunnel at top speed after quarry, their trail can be marked by a path of disturbed ground racing across a field. They burst from the earth to seize their victim in huge, serrated jaws. A bulette knows no fear and never retreats from battle.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Two-legged Prey.</em></strong> The tremorsense of bulettes is sensitive enough to determine the species of the creatures that walk above them. They primarily hunt humanoids. When bulettes happen upon a settlement, they stay within a few dozen miles indefinitely, eating about one victim per day. They particularly enjoy the taste of halfling. Many a halfling village has been harried into nonexistence by a single bulette.</p><p><strong><em>Prized Armor.</em></strong> Armorers pay well for an undamaged piece of bulette scale, a key ingredient in making enchanted armor.</p><h2><strong>BEHAVIOR</strong></h2><p>1 Bursts out of the ground and attacks on sight</p><p>2 Attacking a caravan, marketplace, or holy site</p><p>3 Audibly tunneling nearby; it bursts out and attacks you unless you stay still</p><p>4 Near an open tunnel, eating human corpses</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>SIGNS</strong></h2><p><strong>Wilderness Signs</strong></p><p>1 Disturbed earth and a tree lying on its side</p><p>2 A path of turned-up earth; if you walk on it, you may fall in a sinkhole</p><p>3 A dead and partially-eaten beast; nearby are the signs of recent tunneling</p><p>4 DC 12 Perception check: a faint scraping underground, like something tunneling; it moves when you move and stops when you stop, as if tracking you</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Underground Signs</strong></p><p>1 The entrance of a rough earthen tunnel</p><p>2 A wall trembles as if a digging creature is about to burst through</p><p>3 Quiet rumbling like a distant rock fall</p><p>4 A single steely scale</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>ENCOUNTERS</strong></h2><p>Nowhere is safe from a rampaging bulette, but villages in hilly terrain or on the edges of deserts are particularly at risk.</p><p><strong>CR 5–10</strong> bulette</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2><strong>MONSTER TYPE DESCRIPTION</strong></h2><h2>Monstrosities are magical beings usually native to the Material Plane. Some monstrosities combine the features of beasts and humanoids, like centaurs. Others have bizarre or unnatural appearances, like many-tentacled ropers. Monstrosities could only arise in a world suffused with magic.</h2>",
