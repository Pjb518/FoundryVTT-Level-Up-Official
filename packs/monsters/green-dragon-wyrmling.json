      "bio": "<h2>Combat</h2><p>While individual dragons have their own personalities and tactics, most rely heavily on their breath weapons. They use them whenever they can, preferably from maximum distance and while flying above their enemies.&nbsp;</p><p>When fighting in the open, dragons often circle above their enemies as they wait for their breath weapons to recharge. They only close to melee if their enemies deal significant damage with ranged attacks, or if they can savage an enemy cut off from its allies. Once bloodied, dragons become more aggressive, attacking with bite and claws when their breath weapons aren\u2019t available.</p><p>If a dragon is protecting its lair, it utilizes lair features, traps, allies, and architecture such as escape tunnels to keep up a hit-and-run fight, reappearing only when it has a fully-recharged breath weapon. If the dragon is forced into melee combat, it uses its bite and claws against a single foe. If it has legendary actions like Roar and Wing Attack, it uses them to disperse its other enemies.</p><p>If reduced to less than one-fourth its hit points while fighting in the open, a dragon flies away. However, it fights to the death to defend its lair, unless it can regain the upper hand through tricks or bargains.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Green Dragon Lair Features</h2><p>The save DC for the following effects is 13 + the dragon\u2019s proficiency bonus. Choose or roll one or more of the following lair features:</p><p>1 Lingering toxic fumes suffocate intruders. A bloodied creature in the lair makes a Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On a failure, it has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of its next turn. On a success, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p><p>2 Bloated corpses litter the lair. If a creature disturbs or enters the space of one of these corpses, the corpse erupts with poisonous gas. Creatures within 10 feet of the body make a Constitution saving throw, taking 13 (4d6) poison damage on a failure.</p><p>3 Pools of poison are scattered throughout the lair. If the dragon is within 10 feet of a pool, it can use a legendary action to drink from it, at which point it can immediately roll to recharge its breath weapon. It can\u2019t do so again until the end of its next turn.</p><p>4 The dragon can use Spit Poison on the ceiling of its lair. When it does, the poison reacts with minerals in the rock and creates a green gas that fills a 40-foot-radius cylinder. The area is heavily obscured to creatures other than the dragon. The gas lasts for 1 minute or until dispersed by a strong wind.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Names</h2><p>Arkenox, Blightbane, Greengall, Honeytongue, Malice, Sirivistra</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Legends and Lore</h2><p>With a History or Nature check, characters can learn the following:</p><p><strong>DC 10</strong> Green dragons breathe poison gas.</p><p><strong>DC 15</strong> Most green dragons are cunning liars that can charm you with their gaze and their deceptive words.</p><p><strong>DC 20</strong> Many green dragons have networks of spies and are secret political players.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Description</h2><p>Green dragons enjoy a reputation as cunning schemers who relish twisting the minds of their prey. Green dragons rarely attack without warning: they enjoy combat more when it\u2019s preceded by the frisson of deceit and fear.</p><p><strong><em>Beguiling Words</em>.</strong> Conversing with a green dragon is a mistake. Many find the dragon\u2019s words, an artful mixt of lies and half-truths, nearly irresistible. A creature charmed by a green dragon may reveal closely-held secrets and betray friendships. If a creature appears useful, the dragon will let it go, but the creature\u2019s behavior may be influenced by the dragon\u2019s subtle prompts long after its escape.</p><p><strong><em>Prisoners and Minions</em>. </strong>Most green dragons collect interesting prisoners: minstrels to soothe it, nobles to charm and subvert, and knights and warriors to torment with terror and lies. A green dragon values its stable of prisoners almost as much as its actual treasure hoard.&nbsp;</p><p>Only slightly less precious than its prisoners are the dragon\u2019s many minions: the kobolds and other monsters that guard its lair, the forest creatures that report to it, and the agents throughout the world that are bound to it by charms, bribes, or threats.</p><p><strong><em>Playing Politics.</em></strong> Unlike most chromatic dragons, green dragons are intensely interested in humanoid politics. Many a mysterious assassination was funded with wealth from a green dragon\u2019s hoard. Green dragons sometimes even orchestrate conflicts between two rival factions, favoring the side that it believes to be the most venal and destructive.</p><p><strong><em>Enemies of Civilization</em>.</strong> A green dragon finds cruel amusement in its schemes, but in the long term its meddling has a more sinister purpose: by sowing discord among the humanoids that rule more settled lands, the dragon weakens those who might stand against a draconic conqueror.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Behavior</h2><p>1 Receiving a report from one of its spies</p><p>2 Will pay for specific (but seemingly harmless) information about a human leader</p><p>3 Knows about your mission and can help, for a price</p><p>4 Returning to its lair with prisoners</p><p>5 Fascinating a local commoner or warrior; hasn\u2019t decided whether to eat it or send it home full of lies</p><p>6 Hiding in ambush among emerald-green foliage</p><p>7 Sleeping in its lair, guarded by minions</p><p>8 Patrolling overhead</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Signs</h2><p>1 A low-hanging, greenish fog with an acrid smell</p><p>2 Close-growing, vine-draped trees make travel nearly impossible except on winding paths</p><p>3 Rodents and birds seem to watch you</p><p>4 A treetop village of strange-acting elves: enchanted servants of the dragon</p><p>5 A rift opens and releases a 100-foot-tall plume of poison gas</p><p>6 A clearing containing recently-killed animals such as deer or birds. The cause of death is not apparent. DC 19 Medicine check: killed by poison</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Encounters</h2><p>Green dragons live in forests and jungles. For miles around their lairs, greenery is lush, thorny, and poisonous.</p><p><strong>CR 3\u20134</strong> green dragon wyrmling; green dragon wyrmling with 1d4 kobolds</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 300 gp, 900 ep, 2 jade dragon statues (60 gp each), a concealed bronze key, 2 <em>potions of healing</em>, <em>ring of mind shielding</em></p><p><strong>CR 5\u201310</strong> young green dragon; green dragon wyrmling with 2 ogres or swarm of poisonous snakes</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 1,000 gp, 1,000 ep, 3,000 sp, silver and emerald necklace (250 gp), masterwork lute (250 gp), <em>dust of sneezing and choking</em>, <em>necklace of fireballs</em>, <em>dagger of venom</em></p><p><strong>CR 11\u201316</strong> young green dragon with corrupted unicorn (see unicorn), shambling mound, or troll; young green dragon with 1d4 dragonbound warriors (see warrior) or giant spiders</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 3,000 gp, 12 signet rings from noble families (50 gp each) strung on a chain, magic pool that acts as a <em>crystal ball</em> but can\u2019t be moved, <em>+2 breastplate</em>, <em>dimensional shackles</em></p><p><strong>CR 17\u201322</strong> adult green dragon; adult green dragon with green dragon wyrmling</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 300 pp, 8,500 gp, 5 emeralds (500 gp each), 3 <em>potions of supreme healing</em>, <em>staff of striking</em></p><p><strong>CR 23\u201330</strong> ancient green dragon; ancient green dragon with 1 or 2 dragon cultists and 1d6 + 2 dragonbound warriors (see warrior); adult green dragon with green hag and 1d6 + 6 dragonbound warriors, goblins, or kobolds</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 2,000 pp, 25,000 gp, 2 bejeweled and poisoned gold goblets (2,500 gp each), dozens of letters incriminating the local nobility, 3 <em>potions of flying</em>, <em>crystal ball</em>, <em>ring of invisibility</em></p><p><strong>CR 31+</strong> 2 ancient green dragons; 2 ancient green dragons with fire elemental and mage; green great wyrm</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong> 6,000 pp, 80,000 gp, 10 diamonds (5,000 gp each), one piece of a magic artifact, <em>ring of invisibility</em>, <em>rod of lordly might</em></p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Monster Type Description</h2><p>Dragons include red and gold dragons, which are huge reptilian fire-breathers that number among the world\u2019s most dangerous monsters. This type includes white dragons, which breathe killing frost, as well as smaller reptilian creatures related to true dragons, such as pseudodragons.&nbsp;</p><p></p>",
