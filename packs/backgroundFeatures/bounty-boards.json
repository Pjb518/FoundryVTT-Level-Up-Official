		"description": "<p>You know the common procedures for finding information on wanted people. When you are in a community such as a settlement or a district of a large city, you can spend 1 hour gathering leads on bounties. You learn about one of the following: a villainous threat to this community, a wanted small-time criminal, the identity of a local crime group, a noble looking for “a trustworthy employee,” or a commoner wronged by any of these. You can express which you prefer, but the information you find is determined by the Narrator. Whatever person or group you learn about, you get a lead on their location and some assurance of payment for your work.</p>",
