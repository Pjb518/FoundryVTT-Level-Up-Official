These locations must have access to the network that made you famous. Work with the Narrator to make sure your selections make sense for the story being told. While at one of these locations, you and your companions are treated to a rich lifestyle by a fan, as long as you indulge them with appearances at parties and the like. Being recognized can be a double-edged sword, however. There may be no such thing as bad publicity, but there’s no end of bad intentions.</p>",
