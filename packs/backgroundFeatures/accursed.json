The failed check is ignored, and you immediately roll an Intimidation check with which you have expertise, taking the new roll. However, even a successful Intimidation check does not necessarily produce the result you originally intended, as the creatures around you may recoil in fear and distrust. At the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion, you may keep the expertise die to Intimidation until the end of the scene.</p>",
