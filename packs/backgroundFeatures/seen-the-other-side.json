Creatures of death or the afterlife such as Celestials, Fiends, and Undead can recognize this about you at a glance and will often be more forthcoming and candid with you than other mortals. If one would normally be hostile to you, there is also a 50% chance they will be indifferent instead. You do not gain this benefit with creatures you or your allies engage in combat.</p>",
