		"description": "<p>You transform yourself into a swarm of ravens for the duration. All items carried by you and equipment wielded by you merge into the swarm. While transformed, you retain your hit points and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, but otherwise your consciousness is distributed among the ravens. The swarm may speak, but each word comes from a different raven or ravens, and if the communication is time-sensitive or there are distractions, a DC 5 Intelligence check is required to understand what you say. If the swarm disperses or you are reduced to 0 hit points, you immediately return to your normal form. You can also return to your normal form as a bonus action, ending the spell early.</p><p><strong>Rare: Mortean's Spectral Murder. </strong>The swarm gains the incorporeal movement ability and can pass through solid objects. If the swarm ends a turn inside a solid object, it takes 1d10 force damage and is immediately shunted to the nearest open space.</p>",
