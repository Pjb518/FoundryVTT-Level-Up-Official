On a successful save, the spell ends.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> Target an additional creature within 30 feet of the original for each slot level above 1st.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Rare: Despairing Hideous Laughter.</strong> When the mirth fades the target is affected with crushing grief, sadness, and despair, causing it to sob uncontrollably.
