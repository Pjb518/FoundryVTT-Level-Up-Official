    "description": "<p><strong>Classes: </strong>Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard</p>\n<hr>\n<p>You only require line of sight to the target (not line of effect) and it has advantage on its saving throw to resist the spell if you or your companions are fighting it. Until the spell ends, the target is charmed by you and friendly towards you.</p>\n<p>The spell ends if you or your companions do anything harmful towards the target. The target knows it was charmed by you when the spell ends.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> For each slot level above 1st, you affect one additional target that is within 30 feet of other targets.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Rare: Gorana's Inveigling Charm Person. </strong>The duration of the spell is increased to 8 hours, 24 hours with a 5th or higher level spell slot. In addition, you may increase the casting time to 1 hour to instead have the duration last a year or until dispelled or dismissed by you. If the target is already charmed by you, they have disadvantage on the saving throw against this longer cast version, but on successful save are immune to that version cast by you for 1 year. If you expend a 6th or higher level spell slot you may instead target a creature up to 1 mile away using the 1 hour cast time version, provided you have a piece of them to use as a material component.</p>",
