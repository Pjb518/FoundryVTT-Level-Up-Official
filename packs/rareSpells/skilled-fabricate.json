    "description": "<p>You convert raw materials into finished items of the same material. For example, you can fabricate a pitcher from a lump of clay, a bridge from a pile of lumber or group of trees, or rope from a patch of hemp.</p><p>When you cast the spell, select raw materials you can see within range. From them, the spell fabricates a Large or smaller object (contained within a single 10-foot cube or up to eight connected 5-foot cubes) given a sufficient quantity of raw material. When fabricating with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a single 5-foot cube). The quality of any objects made with the spell is equivalent to the quality of the raw materials.</p><p>Creatures or magic items can't be created or used as materials with this spell. It also may not be used to create items that require highly-specialized craftsmanship such as armor, weapons, clockworks, glass, or jewelry unless you have proficiency with the type of artisan's tools needed to craft such objects.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Rare: Skilled Fabricate.</strong> Spectral artisan’s tools of your choosing appear in your hands as you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you gain proficiency with these tools. Each time you cast it, you may choose a different set of tools. </p>",
