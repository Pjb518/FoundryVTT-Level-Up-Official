The barrier moves with you and prevents creatures other than undead and constructs from passing or reaching through its surface.</p><p>The barrier does not prevent spells or attacks with ranged or reach weapons from passing through the barrier.</p><p>The spell ends if you move so that a Tiny or larger living creature is forced to pass through the barrier.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Rare: Repelling Antilife Shell.</strong> When the spell would force a living creature to pass through the barrier, that creature is harmlessly pushed back into a space of its choosing outside of the sphere and within 5 feet of its original position. </p>",
