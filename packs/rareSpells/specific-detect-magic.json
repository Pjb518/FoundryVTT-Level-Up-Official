When using a 3rd-level spell slot or higher, the duration increases to 1 hour. When using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, the duration increases to 8 hours.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Rare: Specific Detect Thoughts.</strong> You can scan the thoughts of all creatures within range and locate one creature currently thinking about a single subject you choose when you cast the spell. You can read its thoughts as described in the spell’s description. This spell does not reveal the creature having these thoughts, and until you determine which creature it is you cannot shape the course of its thoughts so the information you receive may be limited.</p>",
