On a successful saving throw, the target is instead slowed until the end of its next turn and the spell ends.</p><p>A creature restrained by this spell makes a second saving throw at the end of its turn. On a success, the spell ends. On a failure, the target is petrified for the duration. If you maintain concentration for the maximum duration of the spell, this petrification is permanent.</p><p>Any pieces removed from a petrified creature are missing when the petrification ends.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> Target one additional creature when you cast this spell with an 8th-level spell slot.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Rare: Punishing Flesh to Stone.</strong> When you permanently petrify a target, you can designate a trigger event within 60 feet of the statue which causes the petrification to end. Example trigger events include a creature touching the statue or a specific item, or a word or phrase being spoken.</p>",
