On a failed save, the creature takes 1d4 psychic damage.</p><p>You cannot cast another spell through your spellcasting focus while concentrating on this spell.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Rare: Subtle Dramatic Sting.</strong> When you cast this spell, make a Performance check opposed by the target’s Perception check. On a success, the target is affected by the spell but does not realize it is being targeted by a spell. Each round at the start of its turn, the target gains an expertise die on a Perception check made against the result of your Performance check to realize it has been targeted by a spell </p>",
