		"description": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\">Those destined for a higher purpose by the cosmic forces of Law are not simply bound by rules. They fundamentally understand that it isn&rsquo;t ultimately about them, subsuming their subjective will entirely to something greater than themselves. They stand as a bulwark against rapid change, shield against the careless destruction it can bring, or perhaps an enabler of long entrenched wrongs. To the truly Lawful, the difference matters not.</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Source of Inspiration: Law.</em></strong> You gain inspiration anytime you support or enforce a state of stability and order, or act in opposition of change, unless that change brings about a more perfect state of order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Serve in the royal guard defending an established ruler, turn in rebels to the proper authorities, show restraint and resist the urge to indulge in base personal gratification</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Inspiration Feature: Reliability.</em></strong> Whenever you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check, you may expend inspiration to automatically roll a 10 on the d20. You must choose to do so before you roll.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\">Fulfilling your Destiny</h3>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\">You fulfil your destiny of Law when you preserve a world or cosmic order, becoming fully a tool in service to that order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><em>Ensure the survival of an established nation against widespread revolution and unrest, bind will completely to the service of a deity, preserve the status quo for vast numbers of people</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Fulfillment Feature: Agent of Law.</em></strong> Whenever you roll damage for a weapon or spell, you may choose to use the average instead. Once per long rest you may choose to use the maximum instead. You must choose to do so before you roll. In addition when you spend inspiration on your inspiration feature you may make the roll a 15 instead of 10.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\">You also gain the Lawful alignment trait.</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Table: Law Destiny</strong></p>\n<table style=\"width: 100%; height: 117.578px;\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 16.2903%;\"><col style=\"width: 83.7097%;\"></colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">[[/r 1d6]]</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">Motivation</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: left;\"><strong>Perfefction:</strong> I know or will discover the perfect way and with my example perfect the world, for that which is perfect has no need to change.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: left;\"><strong>Principles:</strong> Ideals are more important than people, even myself.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">3</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: left;\"><strong>Obligation:&nbsp;</strong>I will give what is rightfully owed to others and ensure I get what is rightfully owed to me.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">4</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: left;\"><strong>Sacrifice: </strong>The needs of many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">5</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: left;\"><strong>Stability: </strong>I will support the status quo, and subtly adjust and reform it if needed, because disorder and rapid change always bring more suffering.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">6</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: left;\"><strong>Purity: </strong>I will seek to purge all that is impure within me that I may become more perfect - and if need be from others too.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
