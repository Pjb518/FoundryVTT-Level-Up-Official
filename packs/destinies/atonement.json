		"description": "<p>You carry a heavy burden of guilt, but instead of letting it crush you or rationalizing your culpability away, it motivates you and gives&nbsp;you strength. Plagued by regret or filled with remorse over some past transgression (or perhaps a lifetime of them), your sense of conviction drives you to make things right&mdash; somehow.</p><p><strong><em>Special Feature: Look in the Mirror.</em> </strong>You can replace your destiny with Atonement at any time. You might do so after a heinous misdeed, upon realization of wrongdoing, or after &ldquo;fulfilling&rdquo; your presumed destiny only to find inner desolation.</p><p>You can also change your destiny from Atonement to something else at any time if you manage to reconcile with the source of your guilt early, or you decide that you are no longer sorry for whatever it was that you did.</p><p><em><strong>Source of Inspiration: Repentance.</strong></em> You draw inspiration from undoing harm, resisting old patterns of destructive behavior, and demonstrating that you have changed.</p><blockquote><p>Refuse to partake in a favorite vice, fix something both broken and expensive, save the life of someone you once considered an enemy, donate a generous sum of time or money to repairing some harm that you caused, counsel someone else to avoid destructive behaviors.</p></blockquote><p><em><strong>Inspiration Feature: Atoner&rsquo;s Blessing.</strong> </em>Your wisdom and candor can be a balm to the afflicted. If you spend inspiration and an hour in honest and candid conversation with another creature, you each may remove a level of strife.</p><h3>Fulfilling Your Destiny</h3><p>You fulfill your destiny of Atonement when you fully cast off the burden of your past or manage to find redemption in some other way..</p><blockquote><p>Raise from the dead everyone you killed in your past life, return or replace everything you&rsquo;ve stolen, establish an organization that helps people move on from their destructive pasts, receive forgiveness from someone whose life you ruined.</p></blockquote><p><em><strong>Fulfillment Feature: Balm of the Redeemed.</strong></em> You have a rather different idea of what constitutes &ldquo;hopeless&rdquo; or &ldquo;past help&rdquo; than most people do. Once per long rest you may either remove the Doomed condition from a creature with a touch or cast revivify with no need for material components.</p><p><strong>Table: Atonement Destiny</strong></p><table style=\"width: 100%; height: 117.578px;\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 17.4509%;\"><col style=\"width: 82.5491%;\"></colgroup><thead><tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\"><td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">1d6</td><td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">Atonement Motivation</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\"><td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">1</td><td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\"><strong>Addiction:</strong> Your habit drove you to misdeeds you'll always regret.</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\"><td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">2</td><td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\"><strong>Violence:</strong> You harmed someone who didn't deserve it.</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\"><td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">3</td><td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\"><strong>Greed:</strong> You took from others to benefit yourself.</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\"><td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">4</td><td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\"><strong>Pride:</strong> You pushed others down so you could rise.</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\"><td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">5</td><td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\"><strong>Neglect:</strong> You weren't there when you should have been.</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\"><td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">6</td><td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\"><strong>Misunderstanding:</strong> If only you had known, it wouldn't have happened.</td></tr></tbody></table>",
