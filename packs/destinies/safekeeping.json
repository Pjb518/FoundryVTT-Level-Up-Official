		"description": "<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-26c92929-7fff-fcf8-99cf-28602d99b38d\" dir=\"ltr\">There are important things in the world that deserve to be preserved including (but by no means limited to) works of art, natural resources, places of beauty or power, communities, philosophies, and one-of-a-kind objects. You have dedicated your life to preserving and protecting something, or perhaps multiple somethings be those things abstract or concrete.</p>\n<hr>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>Source of Inspiration: Protection.</strong></em> You derive inspiration from keeping things safe from harm, or implementing protective measures to prevent disasters in the future.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Save someone&rsquo;s life or prevent them from suffering a life-altering injury, make additional copies of a unique work and ensure they are distributed to multiple places so it cannot be lost, record the lore of a community for posterity, prevent the destruction of a relationship through mediation, pass down a skill or tradition in danger of being lost, stop the theft or destruction of something valuable or dangerous.</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>Inspiration Feature: Guardian&rsquo;s Gaze.</strong></em> Your vigilance and commitment to preservation can make a huge difference in moments when it counts, albeit at the cost of your own safety. When a friendly creature or precious object within 15 feet of you would be harmed by an attack or some detrimental effect, you can spend your inspiration (no action required) to cause that attack or effect to target you instead.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>FULFILLING YOUR DESTINY</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You fulfill your destiny when you prevent the loss of something truly massive.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Save an entire region or world from a catastrophe, bring a species back from the brink of extinction, prevent the destruction of a culture, rescue an artistic masterwork from a disaster or war, prevent an apocalyptic event, cure a plague that threatens the lives of thousands.</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>Fulfillment Feature: Eternal Guardian.</strong></em> You have done so much in the service of preservation that you yourself are preserved, becoming ageless. Your effective physical age becomes early middle age (the equivalent of 35 for a human) or if you are already older when you achieve this feature you slowly de-age to that level of physical ability. You may still retain some gray hair or wrinkles (player&rsquo;s discretion) to mark your wisdom and experience. You no longer age (and cannot die of old age or have your effective age altered by magic), are resistant to poison and necrotic damage, have advantage on saves against poison, and are immune to disease. In addition, if you were already resistant to poison or necrotic damage, you become immune to that type of damage instead.</p>\n<hr>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-dc42cd5d-7fff-4c18-94da-06d650ad5b37\">Table: Safekeeping Destiny</span></strong></p>\n<table style=\"width: 100%; height: 167.969px;\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 9%;\"><col style=\"width: 90.8333%;\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 33.5938px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 33.5938px;\"><strong>[[/r 1d6]]</strong></td>\n<td style=\"height: 33.5938px;\"><strong>Motivation</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 33.5938px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 33.5938px;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"height: 33.5938px;\"><em><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-467b86a9-7fff-7eb9-755d-02900fcd7cc4\">Loss: </span></em>Something or someone precious to you was taken, and you have dedicated yourself to preventing such losses in the future.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 33.5938px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 33.5938px;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"height: 33.5938px;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-cfc4daed-7fff-9ff8-100d-cb1900488b45\"><em>Sentiment:</em> </span>Your heart swells with joy at the presence of something or someone, and you desire to maintain it or them.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">3</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\"><em><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-207b5912-7fff-b375-6359-c98361aea680\">Duty:</span></em> You have a strong sense of obligation to preserve something or someone, and will not shrink from it.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">4</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-7fda7533-7fff-c571-957d-acac27ce321f\"><em>Jealousy:</em> </span>The precious!
