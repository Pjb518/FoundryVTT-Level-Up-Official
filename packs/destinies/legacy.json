    "description": "<p>They say that someone whose name is still spoken is not dead, and you aim to achieve immortality by that road. The great driving&nbsp;force in your life is a desire to create something that outlasts you, that marks the world for many years after you have left it&mdash;and perhaps even changes its destiny forever.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Source of Inspiration: Building Blocks.</strong></em> You draw inspiration from progressing toward some great overarching goal or by building up a body of work that can outlast you.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Have some work recognized as exceptional in your lifetime, convince a large number of people to support a cause you believe in, discover or invent something with wide-ranging implications, undermine long-standing physical or social structures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Inspiration Feature: Dogged Persistence.</em> </strong>Those who give up rarely change the world. You may spend inspiration to do one of the following (no action required):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Minimize the damage you take from a single attack or other source (such as a fall, spell, or environmental effect) this turn.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Treat a long rest you take outside of a haven as if it had been taken inside a haven.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reroll an unsuccessful ability check, taking the new roll if it is better.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Restore a spent hit die.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h3>Fulfilling Your Destiny</h3>\n<p>You fulfill your destiny of Legacy when you create something that will last far beyond your time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Invent something that changes daily life for a whole society or a whole world, create a great work that will be presented as a masterpiece for centuries to come, change the structure of a society, change the relationship between two societies dramatically, cure or introduce a widespread affliction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Fulfillment Feature: Changed the World.</strong></em> You are known far and wide. Your prestige rating improves by 4. If your prestige rating is ever 7 or lower, it is instead treated as 8.</p>\n<p><strong>Table: Legacy Destiny</strong></p>\n<table style=\"width: 100%; height: 151.172px;\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 17.4419%;\"><col style=\"width: 82.5581%;\"></colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">1d6</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">Legacy Motivation</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 33.5938px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 33.5938px; text-align: center;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"height: 33.5938px;\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Artistry:</strong> You will create a great work, and future creators will revere your genius</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Innovation:</strong> You&rsquo;re going to change life for everyone with your work</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 33.5938px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 33.5938px; text-align: center;\">3</td>\n<td style=\"height: 33.5938px;\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Greater Good: </strong>The status quo is awful, and you mean to change it for the better.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">4</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Pride:</strong> You will ensure the world never forgets your magnificence</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">5</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Faith:</strong> The current understandings of the divine are all wrong, but you have the answers.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">6</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\"><strong>Ruin:</strong> You&rsquo;re going to burn it all down and throw the ashes into the sea.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
