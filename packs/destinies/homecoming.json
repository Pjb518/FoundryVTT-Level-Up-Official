		"description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Wherever you are now, you know it&rsquo;s not where you&rsquo;re truly meant to be. For some with the Homecoming destiny, their home is a distant memory they strive to return to. For others, home is a future hope: a place they know in their heart of hearts exists, even though they&rsquo;ve never been there. For all, however, home is a place they know they will someday reach, no matter how long the journey takes.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Source of Inspiration</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Press On.</strong> You draw comfort from the thought of home, even when it&rsquo;s hard to endure. You gain inspiration whenever you forgo a comfort or accept a significant hardship in order to better advance your journey.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Willingly partake in a forced march, leave behind someone you&rsquo;ve grown close to, take a shortcut through a perilous region.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Inspiration Feature</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Homeward Bound.</strong> Something inside you calls you on, directing you as to the best path to take. You may spend your inspiration to select a location whose existence you are aware of. The Narrator provides you with a substantial hint or bonus that will allow you to reach that destination or overcome obstacles in your way. Often, this will take the form of a Boon or Discovery or an automatic success on a journey activity (regardless of the initial roll). Likewise, you may also spend inspiration to automatically succeed against the maze spell.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Fulfilling Your Destiny</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You fulfill your destiny of Homecoming when you finally arrive where you were always meant to be.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Reunite with loved ones after a journey of many years, discover the hidden truth about your origins, be accepted back among your people as one of their own.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Fulfillment Feature: </strong>Home Is Where The Heart Is. Having finally returned home, you can never truly be separated from it again, even if your adventures continue. You are always considered to be in a haven when taking a long rest, and any feature or effect that would reduce your fatigue or strife reduces it by twice as much. In addition, once per week, you and your party may gain the benefits of a long rest by taking a short rest. Although a creature cannot benefit from this improved rest more than once per week, this feature does not count against how often a creature may benefit from the improved rest granted by a Grade 2 house stronghold, nor vice versa.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Table: Homecoming Destiny</strong></p>\n<table style=\"width: 100%; height: 151.172px;\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 20.4545%;\"><col style=\"width: 79.5455%;\"></colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">[[/r d6]]</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">Motivation</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\"><strong>Belonging.</strong>&nbsp;Somewhere, someday, you&rsquo;ll find others like you.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 33.5938px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 33.5938px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"height: 33.5938px;\"><strong>Calling.</strong> You don&rsquo;t entirely understand why, but something out there is drawing you toward itself.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 33.5938px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 33.5938px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">3</td>\n<td style=\"height: 33.5938px;\"><strong>Redemption.</strong> Long ago, you fled in shame.
