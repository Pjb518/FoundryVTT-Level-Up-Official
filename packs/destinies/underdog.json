You gain inspiration whenever you score a critical hit against a creature larger than you are, roll a natural 20 on a death saving throw, openly defy a powerful being, or succeed after taking a risk with long odds.</p>\n<p><em>Loudly refuse the orders of a tyrant, follow through with a convoluted or risky plan, succeed at something you were extremely likely to fail.</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Inspiration Feature: A Nose for Trouble.</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Get kicked around long enough and you start to know when trouble&rsquo;s brewing. Whenever you or an ally you can see fails an Insight check, you can use your reaction to spend your inspiration and learn any information that would have been gained by a successful Insight check.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>FULFILLING YOUR DESTINY</h4>\n<p>You fulfill your Underdog&rsquo;s destiny when you finally overcome the odds.</p>\n<p><em>Succeed at a nearly unattainable and grand task, complete a supposedly impossible quest, defeat an insurmountable foe, succeed at a dire endeavor where failure was all but guaranteed.</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Fulfillment Feature: Expendable and Invulnerable</em></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;While being kicked around&nbsp;and batted from adventure to adventure, somehow you always seem to scramble out of the rubble.
