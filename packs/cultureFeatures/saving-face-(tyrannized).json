If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check, you can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum +3), possibly changing a failure into a success. Once you use this trait, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
