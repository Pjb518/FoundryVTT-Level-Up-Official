When you complete a long rest, choose one damage type from the following: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. You have resistance against that damage type until you use this trait to change damage types.</p>\n<p>As an action, you can convey this damage resistance to a willing creature you touch. The damage resistance disappears from you, and lasts on the target creature for 1 hour. You regain the damage resistance at the end of your long rest.&nbsp;</p>",
