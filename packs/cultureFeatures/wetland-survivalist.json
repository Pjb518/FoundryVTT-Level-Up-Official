You can create a ramshackle version of any survival gear (except for maps and rations) with 10 minutes of work if you have access to simple materials such as common household items, battlefield scraps, or the bounty of the forest. Ramshackle survival gear created in this way functions identically to their normal counterparts, except their gold value is always 0 and they break and become useless after 12 hours.</p>",
