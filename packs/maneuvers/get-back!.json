As long as it can hear you, your companion moves up to its Speed toward you in the most direct course it is able to, stopping at the end of its movement or when you are between it and the creature that injured it (whichever comes first). It can also choose to move up to twice its Speed, taking a level of fatigue in the process. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity from creatures your animal companion can see.</p>",
