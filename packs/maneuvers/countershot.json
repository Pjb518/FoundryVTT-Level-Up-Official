Use a weapon to make a ranged attack against an AC equal to the attack roll of the missile. On a hit, the missile is deflected and misses its target.</p><p>At the Narrator's discretion, certain ranged weapon attacks (like a giant's thrown rock) may be too heavy to be deflected by Countershot.</p>",
