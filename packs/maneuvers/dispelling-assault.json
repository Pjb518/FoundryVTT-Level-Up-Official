Until the start of your next turn, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19-20, and when you score a critical hit against a creature any spell of 3rd-level or lower on the creature ends.</p><p>If you already have a feature that increases the range of your critical hits, your critical hit range increases by 1 (maximum 17-20).</p>",
