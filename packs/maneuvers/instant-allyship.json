On a success, the creature is briefly perplexed and not sure you&rsquo;re an enemy, targeting a different creature with the attack instead.</p>\n<p>In addition, until the end of your next turn the creature treats you as an ally (instead of an enemy) for the purposes of traits and other effects, and it cannot target you with attacks.
