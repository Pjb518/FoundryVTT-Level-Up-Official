You recover a spell slot or number of spell points equal to half the minimum which is necessary to cast the spell, rounded down. For example, if you were hit with an acid arrow you could use this maneuver to recover a 1st- level spell slot or 1 spell point. If a cure wounds spell was cast on you with a 5th-level spell slot, you could recover 1 spell point (but not a spell slot). If you already have your full allotment of spell slots for the given level or if your spell points are at their maximum, any excess is lost. The triggering spell otherwise affects you as normal. You may not absorb energy from spells you cast on yourself.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
