Each of those creatures may choose to immediately use their reaction to move up to their speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If they do so, they must use their entire movement attempting to move to safety. What is considered &ldquo;safety&rdquo; is subject to Narrator discretion, but typically, this means moving as far from obvious sources of danger as possible.</p>",
