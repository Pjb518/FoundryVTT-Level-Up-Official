All hostile creatures able to see you consider you to be dead or dying.</p><p>If a creature moves within your reach before the beginning of your next turn, you can immediately stand up and spend exertion to use a Tooth and Claw maneuver you know against it. No action is required to activate the maneuver and any melee attacks made as part of the maneuver have advantage.</p><p>After you have used Wounded Animal Gambit against a creature, if you activate it again before the end of combat it receives a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, it realizes you are playing dead.</p>",
