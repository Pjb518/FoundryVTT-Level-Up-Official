		"description": "<p>Magic and martial skill have never existed to the complete exclusion of one another; just ask a herald. But practitioners of Cutting Omen take the practice further, blending magical energies and effects with raw martial skill to create a uniquely-deadly whole. Cutting Omen practitioners are all spellcasters; they need to be in order to use this school’s techniques, which often require a certain amount of stored magical energy on the part of the practitioner.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Important Note</strong>: <em>Cutting Omen</em> maneuvers often require a certain amount of unspent magical energy to function. This is notated with the \"Requirement\" line. If the requirement is not met, the maneuver cannot be used at that time.</p><p>Despite these requirements, Cutting Omen maneuvers are <strong>not</strong> spells. They are no more susceptible to effects like <em>dispel magic</em> or <em>counterspell</em> than a Herald’s <em>Divine Smite</em> or the breath weapon of a dragon.</p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"></blockquote><blockquote><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"></blockquote><h3 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Using Cutting Omen With Other Material</strong></h3><blockquote><p style=\"text-align: center\">Cutting Omen is designed to work with fighting spellcasters who have access to both maneuvers and spell slots. Right now, the only class that qualifies without a specialized archetype is the herald, and it uses spell slots to acquire its exertion. You can make this available to heralds, certainly, but it’s better for multi-classed warrior/spellcaster types. In particular, characters with the <em>Blade Dancer</em> synergy feat chain should have access to it. Consider adding access to this tradition as an optional benefit of the <em>Blade Dancer feat</em>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"></blockquote><blockquote><hr
