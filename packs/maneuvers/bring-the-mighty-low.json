If the creature&rsquo;s attack hits, it deals an additional damage die and must make a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. On a miss, it must make the saving throw at disadvantage.</p><p>If the attacking creature is two size categories larger than your animal companion, you may direct your animal companion to get under the creature&rsquo;s feet and take that creature&rsquo;s basic melee damage (in addition to any potential damage from the attack) in order to force it to make the Dexterity saving throw as above.</p>",
