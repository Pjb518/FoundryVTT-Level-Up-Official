		"description": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Requirement: </strong><em>a silvered or magic weapon</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You attack a target that can shapeshift, attempting to force it back into its true form. You take the Attack action, including any additional attacks granted by Extra Attack or similar features and must target a single creature with all of your attacks. For each attack that hits, the target must make a save against your maneuver DC or be forced into its true form. This spell also ends spells such as polymorph or class features such as Wild Shape that cause a creature to change its shape. If the target is already in its true form, it takes damage as normal, but suffers no additional effects. If a creature fails its save and you still have attacks remaining, you likewise make them as normal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
