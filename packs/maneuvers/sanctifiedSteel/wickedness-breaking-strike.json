		"description": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Requirement:</strong> <em>you must be concentrating on a spell of the radiant school to use this maneuver</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You make a single weapon attack against the target. If it hits, you deal damage as if you had hit with as many weapon attacks as you can make with Extra Attack, plus one (for example, if you can attack twice with Extra Attack, roll the damage of three attacks) and you lose concentration on the spell after the attack deals damage (allowing you to benefit from any attack benefits provided by the spell before concentration is lost). If this attack is a critical hit, it deals no additional damage, but you do not lose concentration on the spell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
