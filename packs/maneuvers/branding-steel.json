A branded creature has disadvantage on concentration checks and on attacks made against creatures other than you. In addition, a branded creature able to see you cannot move closer to you without making a Wisdom saving throw. The brand on a creature is removed when it regains 30 hit points or more from a healing spell or similar magic.</p>",
