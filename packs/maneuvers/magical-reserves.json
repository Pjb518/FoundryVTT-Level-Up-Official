		"description": "<p>You draw upon the strength of your resolve to replenish your magical reserves, albeit at a cost.</p>\n<p>You may restore spell slots by spending exertion at a rate of 3 exertion points per spell-level of the slot. For example, if you wished to restore a 2nd-level spell slot this way, you would need to expend 6 exertion points. Alternatively, you can restore spell points, spending 3 exertion points per 2 spell points. You may restore any number of spell slots and spell points this way, provided you have the exertion to pay for them.</p>\n<p>The strain of this process takes a metaphysical toll. You take 1 point of necrotic damage per exertion points spent on this maneuver and your maximum hit points are reduced by the same amount until you finish a long rest. This damage cannot be reduced or prevented in any way.</p>",
