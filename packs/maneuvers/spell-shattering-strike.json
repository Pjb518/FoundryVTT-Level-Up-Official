On a hit, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw or the spell is interrupted (expending the spell slot) and it rolls 1d4 to determine how the fraying magic affects it: 1-- the creature's Speed is reduced to 0, 2 -- the creature becomes confused until the end of its next turn, 3 -- the creature has disadvantage on checks made to concentrate on spells until it succeeds on a concentration check, 4 -- the creature is stunned until the end of its next turn and rattled for the next minute.</p>",
