		"description": "<p>You strike a spellcaster and disrupt their control over magic, fracturing the power behind a spell and transforming the energy so it roots them to the spot.</p><p>When a creature you can see within your reach casts a spell, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against it. On a hit, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw or the spell is interrupted (expending the spell slot) and it rolls 1d4 to determine how the fraying magic affects it: 1-- the creature's Speed is reduced to 0, 2 -- the creature becomes confused until the end of its next turn, 3 -- the creature has disadvantage on checks made to concentrate on spells until it succeeds on a concentration check, 4 -- the creature is stunned until the end of its next turn and rattled for the next minute.</p>",
