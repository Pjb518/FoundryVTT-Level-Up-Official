		"description": "<p>Your name is writ in water, and people easily forget your face despite any current fame you may currently enjoy. By taking 1 minute of preparation, you remove signifying details people usually associate you with (such as glasses, a scarf, or an outlandish outfit) and assume an alter ego who is totally forgettable. Anyone outside of close friends and contacts must make a DC 15 Intelligence check to attempt to remember your name, alias, or specific details about you; on a failure they remember only the most basic details but nothing sufficient to easily identify you, and they may not attempt another check until they encounter you again. Your Prestige Rating while assuming this alter ego is always treated as zero.</p>",
