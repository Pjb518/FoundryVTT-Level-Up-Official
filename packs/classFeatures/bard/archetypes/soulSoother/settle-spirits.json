You learn the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.hnvt4tnuww6o4vvi]{Calm Emotions} spell, or another bard spell if you already know it. When you cast this spell, it affects all creature types except for constructs and undead, although at the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion it may affect undead who are driven by strong emotions such as revenants and wraiths.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, when you affect a creature with this spell, you may choose to suppress one level of strife or the confused condition for the duration of the spell.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, for you, calm emotions gains a duration of 10 minutes, and you gain advantage on Persuasion and Insight checks against creatures whose hostile emotions are being suppressed by the spell. At the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion, you may be able to prevent hostile emotions from resuming after the spell&rsquo;s duration by speaking with creatures affected this way.</p>",
