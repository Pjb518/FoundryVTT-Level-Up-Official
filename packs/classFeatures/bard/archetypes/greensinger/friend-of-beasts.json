Normally-hostile creatures will be indifferent, and creatures that would normally be indifferent are friendly. In addition, you are continuously under the effect of the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.z5a26lxyh3esw2rl]{Speak with Animals}&nbsp;spell, and you have advantage on checks to persuade Beasts to help you with non-hazardous tasks. This effect does not emit a magic aura.</p>",
