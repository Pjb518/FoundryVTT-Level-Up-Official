		"description": "<p>Also at level 6, undead creatures also see you as one of their own. Unless you take hostile action against them (such as attacking them or casting harmful spells on them), undead creatures with a CR equal to half your character level or less will either be friendly (if intelligent) or will ignore you entirely (if mindless).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can also choose to have undead creatures with an Intelligence score of less than 10 within 30 feet of you that you have not made hostile dance in time to music you play. To do so, spend a use of @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.m7siz0z3rlng8h20]{Bardic Inspiration} as an action and make any Performance check with a musical or dance component. A number of mindless undead equal to your proficiency bonus that you can see will act as back-up dancers for up to 10 minutes, giving you a +1d4 bonus to the triggering Performance check and ignoring all other stimuli except damage until you stop performing. You can maintain this effect by spending your action each turn to continue the performance (you only need to roll once to start it). If you don&rsquo;t, the effect ends and the undead wander away. This effect ends immediately for all affected creatures if any one of them takes damage. The undead dancers will move with you, but you can only move them up to 15 feet from their starting position each turn, and they must remain within 30 feet of you or they revert to their normal behavior.</p>",
