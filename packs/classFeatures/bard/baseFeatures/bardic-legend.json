		"description": "<p>At 4th level, you write a bardic tale of your adventures. Your bardic legend takes whatever form you like. When you enter a settlement and spend a day playing or recounting the tale, the reputation of youand your allies starts to grow. In addition to&nbsp;receiving local quests suited to the exploits&nbsp;detailed in your bardic legend, when you&nbsp;rest in a settlement that knows your bardic legend, you and your allies regain all spent&nbsp;hit dice over the course of a long rest. In&nbsp;addition, you gain an expertise die on<br>Prestige checks made in the settlement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Starting at 7th level, you craft a second bardic legend. Commoners are either more amenable or afraid of you, depending on the type of bardic legend you create. Choose one of the following skills: Deception, Insight, Intimidation, or Persuasion. You&nbsp;gain advantage on checks made using the chosen skill to influence any commoner that&nbsp;has heard your bardic legend.</p>\n<p>Beginning at 11th level, whenever you&nbsp;enter a settlement, you can name a new&nbsp;bardic legend of your choice. Allies that are&nbsp;part of the tale gain inspiration when they&nbsp;finish a long rest in that settlement. Any&nbsp;other creatures that are part of that tale&nbsp;have their reputations ruined&mdash;either they&nbsp;confront you directly to stop the rumor, or&nbsp;they are unable to hide or deal in that town&nbsp;for the length of time you are in it. Once you&nbsp;have used this feature in a settlement, you&nbsp;can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
