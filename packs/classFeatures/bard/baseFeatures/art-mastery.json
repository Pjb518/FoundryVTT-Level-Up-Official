    "description": "<p>At 11th level, you gain one of the following&nbsp;art masteries. At 17th level, you gain an&nbsp;additional art mastery.</p>\n<p><strong>Percussion: Rolling Rhythm. </strong>When using a percussion instrument as a spell focus, if you cast a spell that targets only&nbsp;one creature, you can target an additional&nbsp;creature. The additional target must be&nbsp;within range of the first (as if the original&nbsp;target were casting the spell). You can use&nbsp;this feature a number of times equal to half&nbsp;your proficiency bonus (rounded down) per&nbsp;rest.</p>\n<p><strong>String Instruments: Melody for All. </strong>You gain a number of melody charges equal&nbsp;to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1),&nbsp;which you regain whenever you finish a long&nbsp;rest. When using a string instrument as a&nbsp;spell focus, if you cast a spell that targets&nbsp;only one creature, you can spend a melody&nbsp;charge to target an additional creature&nbsp;within the spell&rsquo;s range.</p>\n<p><strong>Visual: Dual Masterpiece. </strong>When using visual art as a spell focus, if you cast a bard spell that uses an ally as its point of origin and then cast that spell again on your next&nbsp;turn, the spell is cast as if you had used a&nbsp;spell slot two levels higher. You can use this&nbsp;feature a number of times equal to your&nbsp;proficiency bonus per long rest.</p>\n<p><strong>Voice: Everlasting Song. </strong>When&nbsp;concentrating on a bard spell you cast using&nbsp;your voice as a spell focus, you&nbsp;automatically succeed on checks made to&nbsp;maintain concentration on that spell.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Wind Instruments: Perfect Pitch. </strong>While using a wind instrument as a spell&nbsp;focus, you gain advantage on Deception and Performance checks to conceal the&nbsp;casting of bard spells.</p>",
