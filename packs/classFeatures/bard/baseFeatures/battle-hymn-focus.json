This battle hymn&nbsp;replaces any currently activated battle&nbsp;hymns. Replacing an activated battle hymn&nbsp;does not require expending a use of Bardic&nbsp;Inspiration if the previously activated hymn&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t have a target.&nbsp;In addition, choose one of the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your battle hymns don&rsquo;t require&nbsp;concentration.</li>\n<li>Your battle hymns can affect a&nbsp;number of additional creatures equal&nbsp;to your Charisma modifier (minimum&nbsp;one).</li>\n<li>You learn an additional battle hymn, which doesn&rsquo;t count against the number of battle hymns you know. When choosing this battle hymn, treat your bard level as four higher for the purposes of meeting the hymn&rsquo;s prerequisites. If you change this Battle Hymn Focus, you forget&nbsp;the additional battle hymn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whenever you gain a bard level, you can&nbsp;change your Battle Hymn Focus.</p>",
