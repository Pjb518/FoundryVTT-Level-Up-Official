However, if the target is permanently petrified, instead of being turned to mundane stone, it is shot through with gold ore. If the petrified creature is mined for the ore (which takes an hour and shatters the petrified creature to pieces, meaning that restoring requires life-restoring magic rather than just reversing the petrification), it is worth 20x the creature&rsquo;s CR in gold. Creatures with a CR of less than 1 yield gold worth 1 electrum piece&rsquo;s worth of gold ore.</p>",
