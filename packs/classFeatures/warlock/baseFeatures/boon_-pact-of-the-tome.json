		"description": "<p>Aware of your drive for knowledge, you awaken to find a grimoire left in your pack by your patron: a Book of Shadows. Choose three cantrips. While the book is in your possession, you know these cantrips and they are treated as warlock spells. They don&rsquo;t count against your number of cantrips known. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1 hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony destroys the previous book. The book is collected by your patron when you die.</p>",
