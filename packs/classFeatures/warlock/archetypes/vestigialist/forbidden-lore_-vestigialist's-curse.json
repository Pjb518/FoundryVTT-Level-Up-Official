When you deal damage against the cursed creature, it takes an additional 1d4 damage of the chosen type. This bonus increases by 1d4 at 10th level, and again at 15th and 20th level.</p></li><li><p>You gain a pool of vestige dice, which begins empty. Each vestige die represents a flashes of supernatural knowledge granted by your patron. When the cursed creature ends its turn under the effects of one or more of the Charmed, Confused, Frightened, or Rattled conditions, add one vestige die to this pool. You can spend a vestige die when making an Arcana, History, or Religion check to gain a 1d4 bonus, or when making a death save or concentration check to gain a 1d4 bonus. The pool disappears when you finish a short or long rest.</p></li></ul>",
