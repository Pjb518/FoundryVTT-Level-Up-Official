You gain proficiency in religion, as well as the undead speacialty.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, whenever you use your Eldritch Blast feature, you may choose to deal necrotic damage instead of force damage.</p>\n<p>You also choose one of the following:</p>\n<h2>Deathly Curse</h2>\n<p>You can use a bonus action to place a curse on a creature you can see within 30ft. The curse lasts 1 minute, ending early if the creature dies, you die, or you become incapacitated.</p>\n<p>When you deal damage against the cursed creature, it takes an additional 1 d4 necrotic damage. This bonus increases by 1d4 at 10th level, and again at 15th and 10th level.</p>\n<p>You gain a pool of necrosis dice, which begins empty. When the cursed creature fails a saving throw, add one necrosis die to this pool. You can spend a necrosis die whenever you deal damage with your Eldritch Blast, or a spell of 1st level or higher that deals necrotic damage, to deal an additional 1d4 necrotic damage. The pool disappears when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p>Once you have used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2>Undead Resilience</h2>\n<p>You gain resistance to necrotic and poison damage, as well as an expertise die on saving throws against poison.</p>",
