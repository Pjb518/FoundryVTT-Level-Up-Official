Doing so animates a Skeletal Champion or Zombie Knight, as appropriate. You may have a number of these undead under your control at any one time equal to your Charisma modifier.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The undead all share the same turn, rolling initiative once. While they are within 60 feet, you can use a bonus action to mentally command the undead (they all follow the same command). You may choose the action the undead take and where they move during their next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area. If not given a command, the undead only defend themselves. The undead continue to follow a command until its task is complete.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The undead are under your control for 24 hours, after which they crumble to dust, unless you sacrifice another number of souls to maintain the undead, and your control over them.</p>",
