		"description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">At 6th level, you have the ability to turn a defeated foe into a temporarily loyal ally. When you kill a creature targeted by your Deathly Curse, or under the effects of one of your warlock spells, you can have your patron bind the dead creature to you, summoning a Shadow or a Spectre (your choice) from the corpse. The undead rolls its own initiative, has its own turns, and obeys your verbal commands. The undead disappears after 1 minute, when you are knocked unconscious, or when it is reduced to 0 hit points.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">At 15th level, you can instead choose to have your patron reanimate the corpse as a Skeletal Champion, or Zombie Knight instead.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Once you have used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
