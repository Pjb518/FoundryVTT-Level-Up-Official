The curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target dies, you die, or you become incapacitated. The curse has the following effects:</p><ul><li><p>When you deal damage against the cursed creature, it takes an additional [[/r 1d4 #psychic]] psychic damage. This bonus increases by 1d4 at 10th level, and again at 15th and 20th level.</p></li><li><p>You gain a pool of beyond dice, which begins empty. Each beyond die represents a sliver of the future revealed by the use of this gift from your patron. When the cursed creature fails a saving throw, add one beyond die to this pool. You can spend a beyond die when making a saving throw to gain a [[/r 1d4]] bonus. The pool disappears when you finish a short or long rest.</p></li></ul><p>Once you have used this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
