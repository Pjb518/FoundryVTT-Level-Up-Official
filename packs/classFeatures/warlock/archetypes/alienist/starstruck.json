		"description": "<p>When you take this archetype at 1st level, your study of alien forces conveys mind-altering magical insights. Choose one of the following:</p>\n<h2>Alien Curse</h2>\n<p>You can use a bonus action to place a curse on a creature you can see within 30 feet. The curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target dies, you die, or you become incapacitated. The curse has the following effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you deal damage against the cursed creature, it takes an additional 1d4 psychic damage. This bonus increases by 1d4 at 10th level, and again at 15th and 20th level.</li>\n<li>You gain a pool of beyond dice, which begins empty. Each beyond die represents a sliver of the future revealed by the use of this gift from your patron. When the cursed creature fails a saving throw, add one beyond die to this pool. You can spend a beyond die when making a saving throw to gain a 1d4 bonus. The pool disappears when you finish a short or long rest.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you have used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2>Psionic Awakening</h2>\n<p>You gain telepathy out to a range of 30 feet. You can telepathically communicate with one creature you can see so long as that creature knows at least one language. If you already have telepathy, its range increases by 30 feet.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you cast a warlock spell you can choose to do so psionically, without the need for vocalized or seen components. Once you have used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
