		"description": "<p>When you start a short rest, you can choose a topic to study from the library, browsing through its spectral volumes. At the start of a short rest, you can choose to browse the library for knowledge about the methods for fighting and any strictures or rules governing the behavior of a specific creature you have encountered or know of.</p>\n<p>Choose a specific creature such as a hydra or vampire and make a skill check with advantage (the Narrator will specify the skill to roll) in order to learn about the rules for fighting that creature. If you choose a creature of the Humanoid type, you must specify a specific individual or variety of creature such as &ldquo;werewolves&rdquo; or &ldquo;priests&rdquo; rather than a heritage like &ldquo;elves&rdquo; or &ldquo;dragonborn.&rdquo; You have disadvantage on Perception checks while studying from the spectral library.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the results of the skill check, as long as you can browse the library uninterrupted (successfully completing the short rest), you learn the general best practices for fighting that creature type, including any variants it may have. On the first round of attacks you make against any individual creature of the researched type, your attacks have advantage.</p>\n<p>If the skill check equals or exceeds the creature&rsquo;s CR + 8 (creatures with a CR of less than 1 count as having a CR of 0 for the purpose of this feature) you also gain two additional benefits:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your weapon and&nbsp;@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.ulmcmf3ofmpzmgzf]{Eldritch Blast} attacks against the specified creature type during your first round of combat against it deal an additional 1d8 points of force damage.</li>\n<li>If the creature has specific rules or guidelines for dealing with it (such as it being unwise to accept gifts from fey) or if it has strictures or taboos that govern its behavior (such as certain types of vampire being unable to enter a home unless invited in) you also learn those, if any exist. In most cases, there will be nothing to learn with this; most monsters are not so constrained.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you have used this feature option, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest. You can still use @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.00w208uxevfview0]{Local Primer} at will if you have used this option.</p>",
