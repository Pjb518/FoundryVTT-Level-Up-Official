The creature rolls its own initiative, has its own turns, and obeys your verbal commands. The creature disappears after 1 minute, when you are knocked unconscious, or when it is reduced to 0 hit points.</p><p>At 15th level, you can have your patron conjure for you either a hell hound or a wight instead.</p><p>Once you have used this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
