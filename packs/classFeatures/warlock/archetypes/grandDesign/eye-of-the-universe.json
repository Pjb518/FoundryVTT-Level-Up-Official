You gain the basic augments which can be applied to your warlock cantrips and @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.gd79c49oej8xagdv]{Eldritch Disturbance}. A power point can be used in place of 1 psi dice to augment powers or your cantrips and eldritch disturbance, but are always lost as if you rolled a 1 on a Psi Dice. You can not have more power points at one time than your spellcasting modifier, and all points are lost at the end of a short or long rest.</p><p>To gain power points, choose one of the following features.</p><h2>Find the Order</h2><p>Piecing together destiny empowers you. You gain 1 power point when you utilize your destiny feature or someone within 10ft of you critically hits or critically fails.</p><h2>Baleful Eye</h2><p>You focus the eye of the universe on a single enemy, cursing them as a bonus action. Creatures cursed in this way take an additional 1d4 psionic damage from your attacks and spells. Any time a creature under your curse fails a saving throw, you gain one power point. You may use your curse once per short or long rest.</p>",
