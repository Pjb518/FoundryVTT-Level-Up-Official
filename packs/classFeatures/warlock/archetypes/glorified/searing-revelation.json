You learn two bonus cantrips of your choice from @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.gwhpqtmwnza3rh4p]{Celestial Burst}, @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.ljixftygfhi0sfsf]{Guidance}, @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.bqavvq6ju5ti8hr3]{Light}, and @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.tvtm60k5wxyki9qc]{Sacred Flame}.&nbsp;Additionally, choose one of the following:</p>\n<h2><strong>Celestial Curse</strong></h2>\n<p>You can use a bonus action to place a curse on a creature you can see within 30 feet. The curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target dies, you die, or you become incapacitated.&nbsp;The curse has the following effects:</p>\n<p>When you deal damage against the cursed creature, it takes an additional 1d4 radiant damage. This bonus increases by 1d4 at 10th level, and again at 15th and 20th level.</p>\n<p>Upon placing the curse, your patron fills you with a spirit of perseverance. You gain temporary hit points equal to spellcasting ability modifier + your warlock level (minimum 1). If you already have temporary hit points when you use this feature, you instead increase your temporary hit points by this amount.</p>\n<p>Once you have used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2><strong>Secret of Life</strong></h2>\n<div class=\"editor-content tjs-editor-content svelte-1vyshng\">\n<p>Your patron&rsquo;s revelation grants you knowledge of a lifegiving secret. You gain a pool of solace dice, which represents your patron&rsquo;s help in accessing the shreds of magical grace which suffuse the multiverse. Your solace dice pool contains a number of d6s equal to 1 + your warlock level.</p>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can heal a creature you can see within 60 feet. Spend solace dice up to an amount equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum 1). Roll these dice; the creature regains that many hit points.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, when you hit a creature with a weapon or spell attack, before rolling for damage you learn whether or not that creature has temporary hit points. You can immediately expend solace dice up to an amount equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum 1), roll those dice, and remove from the creature a number of temporary hit points equal to double that total.</p>\n<p>You regain any spent solace dice when you complete a long rest.</p>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
