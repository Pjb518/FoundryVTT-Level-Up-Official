The curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target dies, you die, or you become incapacitated.</p><p>The curse has the following effects:</p><ul><li><p>When you deal damage against the cursed creature, it takes an additional 1d4 radiant damage. This bonus increases by 1d4 at 10th level, and again at 15th and 20th level.</p><p></p></li><li><p>Upon placing the curse, your patron fills you with a spirit of perseverance. You gain temporary hit points equal to spellcasting ability modifier + your warlock level (minimum 1). If you already have temporary hit points when you use this feature, you instead increase your temporary hit points by this amount.</p></li></ul><p>Once you have used this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
