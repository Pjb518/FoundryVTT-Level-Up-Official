		"description": "<p>Starting at 1st level when you choose this archetype, you gain the ability to touch magic itself and change its structure. When you are hit by a spell attack, you can use your reaction to absorb it, distilling it into a primal form of magic called mana, which you can eventually learn to harness. Make a spellcasting ability check opposed by the spellcaster. On a success, you negate the spell and convert it into a number of mana points equal to the level of the spell, regardless of the level of the spell slot it was cast with. Cantrips count as first level spells for this purpose. On a failure, or if you are unable to absorb the mana points that would be gained from the spell, it resolves normally.</p><p>The maximum number of mana points you can absorb equals your proficiency bonus. This resets at the end of a long rest and any remaining mana points disappear.</p>",
