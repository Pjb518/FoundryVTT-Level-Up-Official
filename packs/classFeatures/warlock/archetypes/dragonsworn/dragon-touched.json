		"description": "<p>When you select this archetype at 1st level, you gain a boon of draconic power. Choose a damage type as your draconic damage type: fire, cold, lightning, acid, or poison. Once chosen this cannot be changed. Select one of the following:</p>\n<h2>Dragon Curse</h2>\n<p>You can use a bonus action to curse a creature within 30 feet. The curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target dies, you die, or you become incapacitated. The curse has the following effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you deal damage against to cursed creature, it takes additional 1d4 damage of your draconic damage type. This bonus increases by 1d4 at 10th level, and again at 15th and 20th level.</li>\n<li>The cursed creature has disadvantage on saving throws against fear and the breath weapons of dragons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you have used this ability, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2>Draconic Breath</h2>\n<p>You may use an action to breath out a 15 foot cone or 5 foot wide 30 long foot line. You choose the shape of this breath when you gain this ability and cannot change it. Creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or take 2d6 damage of your draconic damage type on a failure or half damage on a success. If your draconic damage type is cold or poison, they must instead make a Constitution saving throw. This damage increases by 1d6 at 10th level, and again at 15th and 20th level. At 14th level the area increases to a 30 foot cone or a 5 foot wide, 60 foot long line. You can use this attack a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
