The creature rolls its own initiative, has its own turns, and obeys your verbal commands. It retains no memory from its life. The creature disappears after 1 minute, when you are knocked unconscious, or when it is reduced to 0 hit points.</p><p>At 15th level, you can have your patron conjure for you either a <strong>Banshee</strong> or a <strong>Wraith</strong> instead.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p>Once you have used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
