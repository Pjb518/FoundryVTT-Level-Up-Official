You learn the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.omvngnmoo75is54f]{Spare the Dying} cantrip, which does not count against your number of cantrips known. Choose one of the following:</p>\n<h2>Death Curse</h2>\n<p>You can use a bonus action to place a curse on a creature you can see within 30 feet. The curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target dies, you die, or you become incapacitated.</p>\n<p>The curse has the following effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you deal damage against to cursed creature, it takes additional 1d4 necrotic damage. This bonus increases by 1d4 at 10th level, and again at 15th and 20th level.</li>\n<li>When that creature is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies, the curse ends, and you regain hit points equal to 1d8+your warlock level.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you have used this ability, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2>Mortal Defiance</h2>\n<p>You can cast spare the dying as a bonus action. In addition, when you are reduced to 0 hit points as a reaction you may cast spare the dying on yourself.</p>\n<p>When you cast spare the dying on another creature that is actually dying, you regain hit points equal to 1d8 + you Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p>You have advantage on saving throws against poison and disease.</p>",
