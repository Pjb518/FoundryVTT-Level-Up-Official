You can do so once per long rest for every two warlock levels you possess.</p>\n<h2>Righteous Curse</h2>\n<p>You can use a bonus action to place a curse on a creature you can see within 30 feet. The curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target dies, you die, or you become incapacitated.</p>\n<p>The curse has the following effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you deal damage against the cursed creature, it takes an additional 1d4 radiant damage. This bonus increases by 1d4 at 10th level, and again at 15th and 20th level.</li>\n<li>Whenever the cursed creature attacks you or targets only you with a spell, your suffering is rewarded and you regain 1d6 hit points.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you have used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
