You learn the<em> </em>@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.ljixftygfhi0sfsf]{Guidance} cantrip and choose one of the following:</p>\n<h2>Destined Curse</h2>\n<p>You can use a bonus action to place a curse on a creature you can see within 30 feet. The curse lasts for 1 minute and ends early if you or the target dies, if you are incapacitated, or if you use another bonus action to end the curse. The curse has the following effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you deal damage against the cursed creature, it takes an additional 1d4 force damage. This extra damage increases by 1d4 at 10th level, and again at 15th and 20th level.</li>\n<li>You gain a pool of destiny dice, which begins empty. Each destiny die represents a small adjustment you can make to the web of fate. Whenever the cursed creature rolls with advantage or disadvantage, add one destiny die to this pool. When a creature other than you that you can see rolls a d20, you can spend a destiny die (no action required) to add 1d4 to the roll or subtract 1d4 from it. The pool disappears when you finish a short or long rest.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you have used this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can do so again.</p>\n<h2>Step Through the Web</h2>\n<p>You can use a bonus action to teleport up to your speed to an unoccupied space you can see. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
