		"description": "<p>Knights of long-dead magical orders, tacticians specialized in arcane warfare, wielders of ancient weapon-spirits, and students of entities whose battles echo throughout the multiverse. Martialists tap into sources of power that mix magic and combat skill. They may be glorious heroes, brutal villains, pragmatic mercenaries, or even solitary hermits practicing their studies in seclusion. Many war-minded fey, fiends, celestials, and genies traffic with warlocks who become martialists. It has also come to pass that some people forge pacts by coming in contact with certain artifacts such as sentient magic weapons. (The artifacts might even be the patron themselves!)</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Expanded Spell List</h2><p>When you choose a warlock archetype, you also choose an expanded spell list granted by your patron.
