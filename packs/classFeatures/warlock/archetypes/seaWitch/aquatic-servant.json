		"description": "<p>As an action you can conjure your aquatic servant, a water elemental which emerges from a body of water you can see within 30 feet, such as a Tiny-sized puddle or a Large-sized fountain. The aquatic servant takes the form of a beast, the CR of which is no higher than your level divided by 6, and the size of which is no larger than the body of water from which you called it. The servant retains the elemental creature type, and it can appear either as the beast it emulates or as a water elemental molded into that shape. It takes its turn immediately after yours, and it obeys your mental commands.</p>\n<p>You must concentrate on this effect to maintain it, as though concentrating on a spell. The aquatic servant remains in your service for 1 hour, or until you no longer concentrate on this effect.</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you complete a long rest.</p>",
