		"description": "<p>When you take this archetype at 1st level, your lust for wealth fuses with your magical power. Your destiny shifts to Wealth. In addition, choose one of the following:</p>\n<h2>Larcenous Curse</h2>\n<p>You can use a bonus action to place a curse on a creature you can see within 30 feet. The curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target dies, you die, or you become incapacitated . The curse has the following effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>When you deal damage against the cursed creature, it takes an additional 1d4 psychic damage. This bonus increases by 1d4 at 10th level, and again at 15th and 20th level.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Every time you damage the creature, you gain a Non-Fungible Eldritch Token (NFET). At 10th level, this increases to 2 NFETs, and at 5th level, it increases to 3. You can spend NFETs like electrum pieces at a 1:1 ratio, but you must receive some good or service from the transaction, and they cannot be given away.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you have used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2>Kickback</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Whenever you or another creature within 60 feet of you casts a spell with a costly material component, you receive 30% of the gp value of the consumed component as Non-Fungible Eldritch Tokens (NFETs) You can spend NFETs like electrum pieces at a 1:1 ratio, but you must receive some good or service from the transaction, and they cannot be given away.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At 11th level, your NFETs can be spent as gold rather than electrum. In all cases, they appear to the seller as normal coins of their corresponding type and become that type of currency once the transaction is complete and they are in the seller&rsquo;s possession.</p>",
