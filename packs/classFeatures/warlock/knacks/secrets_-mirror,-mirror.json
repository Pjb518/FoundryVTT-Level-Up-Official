You may do so during a short or long rest, receiving or conveying information related to your master&rsquo;s bidding. This entity may also use such surfaces to bridge communication with you on its own terms.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" />You can also use this feature to cast&nbsp;augury&nbsp;without spending spell points. Casting the spell in this way does not require material components, although you do need a reflective surface by which your patron might appear to you. Once you cast the spell in this way, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
