Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag. The spells appear in the book and don&rsquo;t count against the number of spells you know. While the book is in your possession, you can cast these spells as rituals. You can&rsquo;t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you&rsquo;ve learned them by some other means. You&nbsp;can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.</p><p>When you find a spell with the ritual tag, you can transcribe it into your Book of Shadows if the spell&rsquo;s level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up). For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gold for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.</p>",
