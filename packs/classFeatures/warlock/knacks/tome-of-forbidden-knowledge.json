By spending 1 hour reading your Book of Shadows (which may be part of a short or long rest), you may select a number of specialties in Arcana, History, and/or Religion equal to half your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of 1) and gain an expertise die on checks made regarding the chosen specialties. Each time you study the book in this manner, you may replace any or all of these selections with new ones.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, while you have access to your Book of Shadows you may perform the research downtime activity without needing access to a library.</p>",
