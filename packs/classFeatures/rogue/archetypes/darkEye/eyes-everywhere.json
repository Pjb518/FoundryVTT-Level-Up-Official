    "description": "<p>At level 13, you learn to place magical sensors by spending spell energy. As an action, you can expend a spell slot of first-level or higher and touch a solid surface to create a magical sensor about the size of your fist. The sensor is not quite invisible, but is difficult to spot, requiring a Perception or Investigation check against your spell save DC to notice. A sensor has 1 hit point and an AC of 10.</p><p>&nbsp;Once the sensor is placed, it lasts indefinitely. As long as you are on the same plane as the sensor, you can spend an action to look through the sensor as if you were looking through the eyes of a familiar, becoming blind to your own senses for the duration. The sensors can transmit sights, but not sounds, smells, or other sensory information.</p><p>The sensor benefits from your dark eye features. You may have a number of sensors in existence at the same time equal to your proficiency bonus. If you create a new one while at your maximum, you choose which previously-created sensor dissipates.&nbsp;</p>",
