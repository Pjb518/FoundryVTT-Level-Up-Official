You have advantage on Deception and Performance checks made when attempting to mimic another creature&rsquo;s looks, mannerisms, or speech.</span></p>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-2d98543a-7fff-9538-676b-500fa5d05fce\" dir=\"ltr\">In addition, you have a natural talent for perfectly mimicking the sounds of other creatures you&rsquo;ve heard make sound for at least 1 minute. A suspicious listener can see through your perfect mimicry by succeeding on a Wisdom (Insight) check opposed by your Charisma (Deception/Performance) check.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Likewise, you can perfectly copy the signatures and penmanship of a creature if you have studied a sample of it for at least 1 minute. A suspicious reader can identify such forgeries by succeeding on an Intelligence (Investigation) check opposed by your Dexterity (forgery kit) check.</p>",
