You immediately gain the Costumer, Master of Disguise, and Dress Rehearsal options from the Low Profile, Guarded Aspect, and Overpowering Personality features of the rogue class respectively. You still gain these features as normal when you reach the appropriate levels in the rogue class, but may not choose the options you already gained from this feature at those levels.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, you gain proficiency in Charisma saving throws.</p>",
