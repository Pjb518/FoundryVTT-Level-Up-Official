		"description": "<p>Also at 13th level, you have learned to cover up the evidence of the violence you do. If you kill a creature without being observed and can spend 10 minutes with the body and crime scene before being discovered, the death will appear to be an accident on any Investigation check short of a critical success. Even on such a critical success, all the investigation reveals is that the target died via foul play; it does not implicate you (or anyone else) in the death automatically. This feature also renders the body unable to answer a @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.6ia3gup3j0m6oigb]{Speak with Dead} spell and attempting to uncover the actual cause of death via other magical means requires the caster to make a spellcasting ability check against a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</p>",
