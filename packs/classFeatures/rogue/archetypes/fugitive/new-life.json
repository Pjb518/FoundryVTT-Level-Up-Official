You gain proficiency with the forgery kit, and with a week to prepare and a DC 17 forgery kit check, you can create an entirely new identity for yourself that will stand up to all but the most intense scrutiny. Those attempting to penetrate your deception have disadvantage on their checks.</p><p>While inhabiting your new identity, even those who know you by sight must make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence or Charisma modifier (your choice) to recognize you. Even then, you have advantage on Deception checks to convince them they are mistaken.</p>",
