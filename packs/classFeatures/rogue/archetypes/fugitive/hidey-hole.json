You may only have one of these strongholds in any given city, but if one is discovered by your enemies, you can replace it after another 24 hours. You may have a maximum number of safehouses acquired by this feature equal to your proficiency bonus (each in a different community). If desired, you can decommission a safehouse over the course of 1 hour (clearing out possessions and removing clues) to set one up in a new location.</p>",
