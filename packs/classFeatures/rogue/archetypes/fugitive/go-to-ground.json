To do so, you must spend 24 hours preparing (cleaning out your residence, covering up your paper trail, planting false clues, and so on) and then promptly depart the location. Your trail goes completely cold, confounding even those concretely aware of your previous location with the multiple conflicting sets of evidence you left behind. Fleeing in this way grants you an expertise die and advantage on Deception checks to conceal your destination, point of departure, and personal identity for three days after your departure. Once you have used this feature, you must wait a week before you can use it again.</p>",
