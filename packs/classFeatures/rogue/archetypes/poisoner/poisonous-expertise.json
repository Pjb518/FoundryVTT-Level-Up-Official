You gain an expertise die to checks made with the poisoner’s kit, and if you fail a check to harvest poisons, you do not risk poisoning yourself. When you successfully use your poisoner’s kit to harvest poisons, you harvest additional doses equal to half your proficiency bonus. </p><p>You also are especially adept at slipping substances onto innocuous items and into food and drink. You make all Stealth, Deception, and Sleight of Hand checks to conceal poison, drugs, potions, or similar substances in food, drink, or on unattended inanimate objects with advantage.</p>",
