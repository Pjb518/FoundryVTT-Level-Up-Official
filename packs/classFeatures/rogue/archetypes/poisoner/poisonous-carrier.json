		"description": "<p>At 17th level, you learn a truly insidious trick: the ability to turn your enemies into a walking trap.</p><p>When you hit a creature with an attack and do not have disadvantage, you can spend 1 dose of advanced poison to mark that creature with a poisonous sigil. Alternatively, you can spend 1 minute to imbue an item of food or drink with a minor magical effect which marks the next creature to consume it. The next time a marked creature is within 10 feet of another creature friendly to it (which can either be a specific creature you specify or any of its allies, at your option), the sigil detonates, filling the area within 20 feet of the creature with poisonous gas. A creature that enters the gas or begins its turn in the gas must make a Constitution saving throw, taking poison damage equal to the bonus damage from your Sneak Attack feature on a failed save and becoming poisoned for one minute. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half damage and is not poisoned. Once you have used this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum once) you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest. The mark persists for a number of hours equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) and then dissipates on its own. It may also be dispelled as if it were an 8th-level spell.</p><p>In addition, you are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition.</p>",
