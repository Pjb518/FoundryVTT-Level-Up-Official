		"description": "<p>At 9th level, you learn one of the following trap capabilities. When using Trapmaking to create a trap, you can choose to augment it with the new capability, which is triggered when your trap damages a creature.</p>\n<h2>Immobilization Trap</h2>\n<p>The target is caught in the jaws of the trap. The target&rsquo;s movement speed is reduced to 0. A creature can use an action or legendary action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature on a success. Building this trap requires a hunting trap, which can be recovered after the trap is triggered.</p>\n<h2>Poison Trap</h2>\n<p>You add a contact or injury poison to the trap, which consumes the poison. The victim of the trap is affected by the poison.</p>\n<h2>Vial Trap</h2>\n<p>You add a vial of liquid, such as acid or alchemists&rsquo; fire, to the trap, which consumes the liquid. Each creature within 5 feet when the trap is triggered makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature is splashed with the liquid.</p>",
