If you are already proficient with checks using a forgery kit, you instead gain an expertise die. In addition, you can spend a week engaging in a campaign to discredit an enemy using forged letters and other made-up evidence of misdeeds. Make an Intelligence check with a forgery kit with a DC equal to the passive prestige of your enemy. If you succeed, they are afflicted with a random short term mental-stress effect and their prestige is reduced by the amount you beat their DC by for the purposes of retaining followers and calling in favors for [[/r 1d6]] days or until they take active steps to clean up their reputation (at the DM&rsquo;s discretion, the negative effects could be more long lasting). On a failure (or a successful opposed Investigation roll by an interested party), your deceit is known to your target and the general public.&nbsp;</span></p>",
