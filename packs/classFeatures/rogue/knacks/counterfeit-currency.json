In addition, you have mastered the dastardly art of coin clipping and counterfeiting banknotes and bonds. You may maintain a rich lifestyle without paying for it, and you earn double the amount of gold when performing the Illegal Work downtime activity when making checks using a forgery kit. When performing this downtime activity, you may choose to attempt work of a Nearly Impossible difficulty, which requires a DC 30 check, affords a rich lifestyle, and rewards [[/r 10d6 * 3]] gold (before doubling). If you are not caught during this downtime activity, you are assumed to have successfully exchanged your false funds for genuine money.&nbsp;</span></p>",
