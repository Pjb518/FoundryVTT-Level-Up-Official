To fake the casting of a spell you can use an action to make a Sleight of Hand check with a DC equal to 20 + twice the spell level and expend a number of charges from your magician&rsquo;s kit equal to the spell level (cantrips use no charges). People who disbelieve you can make an Arcana or Religion check opposed by your original roll. The faked spell has no effect beyond looking and sounding like the real spell. At the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion, you can attempt higher level spells or spells from other schools of magic, but they require additional preparation and cost to pull off.</p>",
