In addition, you have a special inexperienced follower called a Body Double who looks identical to you and who can attend public gatherings in your stead, providing you a valuable alibi and acting as a decoy. If your Body Double dies, you can hire a new one for 500 gp, though you may only have one Body Double at a time. This follower does not count against your normal limit. </span></p>",
