You must be proficient in a skill or tool in order to gain an expertise die from Guarded Aspect.</p><h2>Hidden Signs</h2><p>You gain an expertise die on Sleight of Hand checks. You can use body language and hidden hand signals to communicate a short message to some observers while hiding it from others. Make a Sleight of Hand check opposed by the Insight checks of observers from whom you want to hide your communication. On a success, a creature is not aware that you sent a message. On a failure, the creature is aware that you signaled but doesn&rsquo;t know the content of your message. If you fail by 5 or more, the creature learns your message.</p><h2>Master of Disguise</h2><p>You gain an expertise die on checks made with the disguise kit. As long as you are wearing a disguise, your true identity can&rsquo;t be determined even if your disguise fails. Additionally, you can don or doff a disguise as an action.</p><h2>Seen It All</h2><p>You gain an expertise die on Insight checks.
