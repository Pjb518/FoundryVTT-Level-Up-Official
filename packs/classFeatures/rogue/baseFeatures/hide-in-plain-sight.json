When you see a creature look in your direction, you can use your reaction to hide even if you have nothing to hide behind as long as you remain in the same square without moving or taking actions. Until you move or take an action or a reaction, you are invisible to that creature. If you are targeted by an effect that requires a Dexterity saving throw, you may choose to fail it to remain invisible to the creature.</p>",
