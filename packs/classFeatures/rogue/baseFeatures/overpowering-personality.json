You must be proficient in a skill in order to gain an expertise die from Overpowering Personality.</p><h2>Dress Rehearsal</h2><p>You gain an expertise die on Performance checks. You can spend 10 minutes practicing a skill of your choice, at the end of which you make a Performance check. You can use this result to replace the die roll of one ability check you make using that skill in the next hour. You may decide to use this feature after seeing the die roll. Once you have used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>Psych Out</h2><p>You gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks. As an action, you can make an Intimidation check opposed by the Charisma check of a creature that can see you. On a success, the next attack roll or opposed ability check you make against that creature within the next 10 minutes is made with advantage. Once you&rsquo;ve failed an opposed Intimidation check, you can&rsquo;t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Roguish Charm</h2><p>You gain an expertise die on Persuasion checks. After you spend a minute in conversation with a creature that is not hostile, you may make a Persuasion check opposed by its Insight. On a success, the creature is nonmagically charmed by you for 1 hour. The charm ends early if you or your allies harm the creature. Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature successfully, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Social Expertise</h2><p>You gain an expertise die on checks made with one of the following skills: Deception, Insight, or Sleight of Hand.</p>",
