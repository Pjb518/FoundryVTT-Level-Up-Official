Choose one of the following options.&nbsp;You must be proficient in a skill or tool in order to gain an expertise die from Shrewd Judgment.</p>\n<h2>Quick Frisk</h2>\n<p>You gain an expertise die on Sleight of Hand checks. You can touch a target to learn what they are carrying. Make a Sleight of Hand check opposed by the target&rsquo;s Perception. On a success, you learn what types of objects they are carrying. If they are carrying coins, you know the approximate number. For the next 24 hours, any Sleight of Hand checks you make against the target have advantage. On a failure, you can&rsquo;t use Quick Frisk against that target for 24 hours.</p>\n<h2>Social Expertise</h2>\n<p>You gain an expertise die on checks made with one of the following skills: Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion.</p>\n<h2>Spot Tell</h2>\n<p>You gain an expertise die on Insight checks. Whenever a creature makes a Deception check opposed by your Insight check and you win the opposed check, you also learn to recognize signs that the target is bluffing. For the next 24 hours, you have advantage on Insight checks made against the target.</p>\n<h2>Tricky Interrogation</h2>\n<p>You gain an expertise die on Deception checks. When you ask a yes or no question to a creature you can see, you can make a Deception check opposed by the target&rsquo;s Deception check. On a success, you learn whether the target believes the answer to be yes or no, even if they didn&rsquo;t reply. On a failure, you can&rsquo;t use Tricky Interrogation against that target for 24 hours.</p>",
