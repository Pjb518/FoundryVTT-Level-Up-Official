		"description": "<p>At 14th level, your power and reputation are such that your very presence on the field of battle is enough to inspire an enemy to surrender. Your prestige rating increases by 1, and when you take an action to make an Intimidation or Persuasion check and offer a target enemy creature with a Challenge Rating lower than your psyknight level the opportunity to surrender, you can add your Prestige rating to the roll. On a success, the target surrenders or attempts to flee (Narratorâ€™s discretion). On a failure, the target neither surrenders nor flees, but if your Prestige rating is higher than theirs, they have disadvantage on attacks that target you. This feature does not affect creatures with an Intelligence score of less than 3, without self-awareness (such as certain constructs), or that are immune to psychic damage.</p>",
