At 2nd level, choose an option from the following.</p>\n<h2>The High Road</h2>\n<p>You value life and peace, understanding that powers used irresponsibly can cause great harm. As an action you can expend one of your hit dice and roll it. An adjacent creature you can touch recovers a number of hit points equal to your roll. You cannot gain hit points yourself by using this feature. Additionally, you gain an expertise die with Persuasion checks.</p>\n<h2>The Steep Climb</h2>\n<p>You value knowledge and power, trusting in and relying on no one but yourself to excel; others are but footholds to boost you ever higher. As a bonus action you can expend one of your hit dice and roll it. The next attack you make does additional damage equal to your roll. Additionally, you gain an expertise die with Intimidation checks.</p>\n<h2>The Axis of Balance</h2>\n<p>You value the natural ebb and flow of the universe, respecting the danger of upsetting the cosmic balance and seeing past the constraints of a binary morality. As an action you can expend one of your hit dice and roll it. You recover a number of hit points equal to your roll. Additionally, you gain an expertise die with Insight checks.</p>",
