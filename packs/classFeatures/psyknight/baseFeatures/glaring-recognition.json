You gain darkvision within 30 feet, and you gain an expertise die on Persuasion checks. If you already had darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.</p>\n<h2>Flames (The Steep Climb)</h2>\n<p>Blazing fire seems to smolder in your eyes and burn in your veins, making you feverish to the touch. You gain resistance to fire damage and an expertise die on Intimidation checks.</p>\n<h2>Mystery (The Axis of Balance)</h2>\n<p>Like dark pools reflecting the infinite night sky, your eyes are impossible to fathom. You gain truesight within 5 feet and an expertise die on Insight checks.</p>",
