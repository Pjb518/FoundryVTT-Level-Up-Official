You may expend a use of Wild Shape to cast cure wounds at a spell level equal to 1/3 your druid level. </p><p>In addition, when you restore a creature’s hit points, you may choose to restore twice as many hit points as normal. Once you restore hit points in this way you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
