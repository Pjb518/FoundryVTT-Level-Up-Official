Have faith in yourself, your actions, and above all the order which you serve.</p><p>• Loyalty Above All. Your word is your bond, and loyalty is an integral part of who you are.</p><p>• Question Everyone. All outside of your order should be regarded as potential heretics, lest worldly connections prevent you from carrying out your duty.</p><p>• Without Mercy. You must pass judgment without mercy as you carry out divine retribution.</p><p></p><p>Archetype School</p><p>Add the communication school of magic to your list of herald spells.</p>",
