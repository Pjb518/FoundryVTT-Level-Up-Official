Also at 1st level, you gain proficiency with Nature, and you learn the druidcraft cantrip (this does not count against your total cantrips known).&nbsp;</p><p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can’t decipher it without magic.</p>",
