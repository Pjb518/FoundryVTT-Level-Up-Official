A 9th level, you can cast any witch spell with the ritual tag, even if you do not have it prepared. In addition, at 9th level, and again at 18th level you may choose one of the following abilities:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><strong>Book of Dreams</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\">You may select one ritual spell on your spell list and add it to a dream journal. Once per long rest while sleeping or trancing, you may ritually cast one of the spells in your journal. Each time you gain a witch level, you may add another ritual spell you know to the list. In addition, you always have the dream spell prepared, it does not count against the number of prepared spells, and you may ritually cast it even though it does not have the ritual tag, but only while you are sleeping or trancing.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><s><strong>Coven Casting</strong></s></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><s><strong>Ritual Attire</strong></s></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><s><strong>Candle Magic</strong></s></p>",
