Choose one of the following options.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.a9m3vhe9x3tho5o6]{Aura of the Champion: Aura of Darkness}</strong> After initiative is rolled, when a hostile creature starts its turn in your aura or first enters into it on a turn, it makes a Wisdom saving throw or becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. Once a creature has been frightened by this aura, it is immune to the aura&rsquo;s effects for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.cnwri456q5q5jqet]{Aura of the Champion: Aura of Light}</strong> An unconscious ally with 0 hit points that starts its turn in your aura automatically succeeds on one death saving throw each turn. Once a creature has succeeded on three death saving throws while in your aura, it cannot benefit from this effect until it has finished a long rest.</p>",
