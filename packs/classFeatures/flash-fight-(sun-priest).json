You can use an action to touch a hostile creature within your reach, gently illuminating it with your divine will and granting advantage on attacks made against it before the start of your next turn.</p><p>Alternatively, you can use an action to touch an ally within reach, surrounding them with a coruscating shimmer of bright light. Until the start of your next turn, creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against the touched ally.</p><p>Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
