		"description": "<p>You can turn nature in its rawest elements into deadly weapons no matter your form. Once each turn, you can use a bonus action to choose a target point within 30 feet and one of the following element options. If the element you choose is not present at or near the target point, any damage dealt by this feature is halved, you have disadvantage on your spell attack, and creatures have advantage on any saving throws made to resist it.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>Air.</strong> Each creature within 20 feet of that point must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 3d8 + your Wisdom modifier and is flung up 20 feet away from the target point in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes&nbsp;1d8&nbsp;bludgeoning damage. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or it takes the same damage and is knocked prone. If the saving throw is successful, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn’t flung away or knocked prone.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">In addition, all ranged attacks within 30 feet of the target point have disadvantage until the beginning of your next turn.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>",
