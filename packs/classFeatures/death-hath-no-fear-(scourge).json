They instead drop to 1 hit point, they are immune to damage until the end of their next turn (though they must still make a Constitution saving throw or die if they would take massive damage without this immunity), and they have advantage on attack rolls until the end of their next turn.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\">However, they are also frightened of you for the next minute. You cannot use any spell or ability to remove this frightened condition, though other creatures can, and if a targeted creature is normally immune to fear they lose that immunity for the duration. This also still counts as being reduced to 0 hit points for the purposes of gaining fatigue or strife at the end of combat.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\">Once you have done so, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
