You cannot place more than one creature on a given initiative count unless all other initiative counts are filled. If the combat includes creatures with Legendary Resistance, they roll initiative normally, but you may adjust the initiative of one such creature up or down by an amount equal to your Intelligence modifier and may still affect all other creatures in the combat. Creatures entering combat on subsequent rounds roll initiative normally.</p>",
