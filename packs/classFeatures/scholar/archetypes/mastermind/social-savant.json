In addition, you gain an expertise die on all checks with the chosen skill. At level 7 this increases to a d6, at level 10 it increases to a d8 and your maximum size for expertise die on the chosen skill increases to d10, and at level 14 increases to a d10 and your maximum size for expertise die on the chosen skill increases to d12. You may always choose to use Intelligence on checks with the chosen skill.</p><p>You add @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-feats.Item.8xaw9qmjsa6hp8d7]{Well-Heeled} to the list of bonus feats you may select.</p>",
