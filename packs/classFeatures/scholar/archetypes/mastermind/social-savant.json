If you are already proficient with all three, you instead choose one to gain expertise and gain proficiency with another skill from the scholar list. In addition, you gain an expertise die on all checks with the chosen skill. At level 7 this increases to a d6, at level 10 it increases to a d8 and your maximum size for expertise die on the chosen skill increases to d10, and at level 14 increases to a d10 and your maximum size for expertise die on the chosen skill increases to d12. You may always choose to use Intelligence on checks with the chosen skill.</p>\n<p>You add @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-feats.Item.8xaw9qmjsa6hp8d7]{Well-Heeled} to the list of bonus feats you may select.</p>",
