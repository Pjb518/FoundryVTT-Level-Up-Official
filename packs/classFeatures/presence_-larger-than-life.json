You have advantage on Intimidation checks made to threaten someone with your magic. On a failure, your target is unconvinced and unless you make good on your threat with an unambiguous show of force to prove your mettle, this feature no longer functions until you prove your reputation again. Additionally, features and traits that attempt to evaluate how tough you are, such as the fighter’s Size Up, always give the impression that you are more dangerous than you actually are.</p>",
