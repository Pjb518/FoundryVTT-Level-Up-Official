		"description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">At 14th level, you have learned how to use the natural forces around you to compel the undead to obey you. You may expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to force an undead you can see within 60ft to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure the undead becomes a loyal servant to nature, willing to obey you for a number of hours equal to your Wisdom modifier. It remains under your control until this time passes, you choose to end the effect, it is reduced to 0 hit points, or you use this feature again.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each time the undead takes damage, it makes a new saving throw against this effect, ending it on a success.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The undead has its own turn, rolling its own initiative. While it is within 60 feet, you can use a bonus action to mentally command the undead. You may decide the action the undead takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area. If not given a command, the undead only defends itself. The undead continues to follow a command until its task is complete.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A creature of a higher challenge rating than your druid level automatically succeeds on its saving throw.</p>",
