The creature makes a Charisma saving throw against your Furious Critical DC. On a failure, it makes or accepts a challenge. The nature of this challenge is at the Narrator’s discretion but is usually a duel or opposed check: archery with Dexterity,&nbsp;arm-wrestling with Strength, competing with a gaming set, distance running with Constitution, wrestling with Athletics, and so on.</p>",
