		"description": "<p>At 6th level, you can prepare a little something special for your adventures. Choose one of the following options.</p>\n<h2>Deploy Automaton</h2>\n<p>Once between long rests, when you have access to your gear, you can spend 1 minute to deploy an automaton of a variety of your choice (Chapter 8: Alien Bestiary). Your automaton appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to you. It is active for 1 minute, after which it returns to sleep mode and stores itself in your gear. Whenever you finish a long rest, any hit points lost by your automaton are restored. While active, its AI is limited, and unless directed it uses its turn to take the Dodge action.</p>\n<p>You can command the automaton using voice control or one of your devices with no action required, which it follows to the best of its ability until the task is completed or you issue a new command. Any saving throws caused by your automaton utilize your science save DC and your automaton gains a bonus to its attack and damage rolls equal to your Intelligence modifier. If your automaton is lost or destroyed, you can create a new one over the course of a long rest with 50 credits worth of replacement parts.</p>\n<h2>Hot-Swap</h2>\n<p>Once between long rests you can spend one minute to make adjustments to an energy weapon using your engineer’s toolbox. Select a damage type from the following list: cold, fire, force, lightning, radiant, thunder. The weapon’s damage type changes to that damage type for 1 hour.</p>\n<p>After 1 hour, the weapon breaks and cannot be used until you have completed a long rest.</p>",
