		"description": "<p>At 10th level, using your engineerâ€™s toolbox, you can provide additional protection for you and your allies. Choose one of the following options:</p>\n<h2>Carbon Lattice</h2>\n<p>You have a small army of nanites which can produce walls of carbon fiber lattice in moments. You can command your nanites as an action to instantly build a wall in an area you designate within 120 feet. Between long rests, your nanites can produce a total of up to 100 feet of carbon fiber lattice. Each 10-foot section of lattice is 6 inches thick, has 15 AC and 100 hit points. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it. The carbon fiber lattice is not proofed for use against a hard vacuum.</p>\n<h2>Personal Shielding</h2>\n<p>You can create a temporary personal forcefield. Spend one minute and choose one of the following damage types: cold, fire, force, lightning, radiant, thunder. A number of creatures of your choice up to your proficiency bonus within 60 feet gains resistance against that damage type for one hour.</p>",
