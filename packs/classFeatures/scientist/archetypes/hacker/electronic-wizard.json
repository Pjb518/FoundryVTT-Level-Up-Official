Hacking maneuvers for you are your choice of actions or bonus actions, and you can do both in a single turn without spending an additional countdown die.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can hack multiple systems simultaneously. Each system you hack simultaneously uses the same combined hacking countdown pool. When the pool is empty, your over-exerted gear is unable to cloak itself and you are locked out of all the networks you hacked simultaneously.</p>",
