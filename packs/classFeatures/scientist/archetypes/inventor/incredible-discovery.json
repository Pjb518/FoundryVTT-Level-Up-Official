		"description": "<p>At 14th level, you make the most incredible&nbsp;discovery of your career and invent a mysterious device which is your gateway to the universe. This device looks however you like (although the Narrator might have a particular artifact in mind for you to use), and uses nearly inconceivable technology like temporospatial tesseract folding or quantum improbability. The device cannot be operated by anybody other than you.</p>\n<p>By spending 10 minutes, you can use this device to open a portal in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet. The portal takes up a Medium-sized space, but its actual dimensions are indeterminate. It leads to any other point in the universe you designate (even locations you only know by description) and remains open for up to one hour.</p>\n<p>The device is not 100% reliable, and while you can choose your destination, you are only guaranteed to arrive near the target at a location chosen by the Narrator.</p>\n<p>At the Narratorâ€™s discretion, at 20th level your device improves further and your portal can traverse not just the universe but the whole multiverse and even different time periods. The planes of existence, eras, timelines, and transcendent states available are up to the sole discretion of the Narrator.</p>\n<p>Once you have used this feature you cannot use it again until you have finished a long rest.</p>",
