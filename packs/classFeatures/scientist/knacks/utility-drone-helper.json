		"description": "<p>You have the service of a<strong> utility drone</strong>, a robot you command with voice control or through one of your devices. Your drone normally hides amidst your gear, but you can deploy it as an action. In combat, it takes its turn immediately after you. It follows your verbal directions with no action required, but commanding it to attack uses your action and its reaction.</p>\n<p>Repairing your drone is free if you have access to its remains and your tools of science over the course of a long rest. Otherwise, the materials to replace your drone cost 25 credits. If its signal is ever jammed, your drone does its best to return to your last known location.</p>",
