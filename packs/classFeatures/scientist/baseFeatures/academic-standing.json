Choose one of the following features:</p>\n<h2>Doctor of Science</h2>\n<p>You have a degree (or the equivalent) from a prestigious university or other institution certifying that you have both mastered and advanced your academic field. You gain a title that reflects your erudition, such as “doctor” or a similar term from the culture that educated you. Presentation of your degree (such as on the wall in your office or a digital copy attached to your resume) may compel certain people of neutral disposition to better trust your discretion, judgment, and professional opinion. Your Prestige score increases by 1 rank, and you gain an expertise die on all Science checks.</p>\n<h2>Officer’s Academy</h2>\n<p>You got your education by virtue of your proximity to a military force, where learning is not for its own sake but for the sake of the security of your people. You have a military rank and title (unless you have retired from service), potentially opening doors that would not be available to a civilian. You gain proficiency with Insight. You also gain an expertise die on opposed rolls against Intimidation checks and saves made to resist fear effects.</p>\n<h2>Renegade Innovator</h2>\n<p>Creation and discovery are more important to you than anything else, such as law, decorum, and even your personal health. During a long rest, you can use tools for crafting instead of sleeping and still receive the full benefits of the long rest. Your raw demeanor resulting from your many sleepless nights grants you an expertise die on Intimidation checks.</p>",
