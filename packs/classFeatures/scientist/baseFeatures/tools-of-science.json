You gain proficiency in those tools.&nbsp;Your tools also include expendable resources, which can limit the frequency with which you use certain features.&nbsp;If you become separated from your gear, your praxes are ineffective or unable to be used. Your features are restored to normal once you retrieve or replace your tools.</p>",
