Choose one of the following.</p>\n<h2>Alien Resonance</h2>\n<p>When communicating with a creature with which you share neither a language nor a creature type, you have advantage on Charisma checks made against that creature.</p>\n<h2>Intuit Probability</h2>\n<p>Equations of chaos and cosmic probability stream constantly through your mind. Three times between long rests, you can assess the likely results of a specific course of action that you intend to take within the next 30 minutes. The Narrator chooses from the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Favorable (good results likely)</li>\n<li>Unfavorable (bad results likely)</li>\n<li>Costly (both good and bad results likely)</li>\n<li>Inconsequential (results that aren’t especially good or bad)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This calculation does not account for possible circumstances that could change the outcome, such as making additional preparations.</p>\n<h2>Radical Interdisciplinarian</h2>\n<p>At your stage in learning, each new lesson informs the next, creating in you a cascading chain of expertise. You gain a number of additional skill specialties equal to your proficiency bonus, and an additional new specialty whenever your proficiency bonus increases.</p>",
