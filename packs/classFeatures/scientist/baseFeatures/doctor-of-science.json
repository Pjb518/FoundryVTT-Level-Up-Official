You gain a title that reflects your erudition, such as “doctor” or a similar term from the culture that educated you. Presentation of your degree (such as on the wall in your office or a digital copy attached to your resume) may compel certain people of neutral disposition to better trust your discretion, judgment, and professional opinion. Your Prestige score increases by 1 rank, and you gain an expertise die on all Science checks.</p>",
