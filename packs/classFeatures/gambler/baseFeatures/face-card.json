You gain advantage on Intimidation checks while gambling.</p></li><li><p>Queen: A silver tongue and an honest game make you a welcome guest at tables across the land. With a few words you can get an appointment to meet upper class individuals for a hand or a throw of dice. You also gain expertise on Persuasion checks made while gambling.</p></li><li><p>King: High and Mighty, you&rsquo;re well known to be a braggart and a loudmouth.
