All psionic powers belong to one or more of these disciplines. As your psionic power grows, your focused dedication allows you to manifest more strongly within one discipline over the others. You gain the following benefits from this focused specialization:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You learn one power from this discipline. This power does not count against your number of powers known.</li>\n<li>Once per long rest, you can manifest a power you know from this discipline without expending points from your reservoir as long as that power’s level doesn’t exceed your current power rating. You must still expend points for any surge options you wish to apply.</li>\n</ul>",
