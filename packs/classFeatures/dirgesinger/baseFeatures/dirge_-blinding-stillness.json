At all other times it is Blinded in all of its senses, even senses that do not require sight. For example, while using a move action or a Cunning Action to move, the creature would have truesight. While using an action or reaction to attack or cast a spell, even if while splitting up a move action, the creature would be Blinded unless the creature is explicitly using an attack, maneuver, or spell that includes willing movement.</p>",
