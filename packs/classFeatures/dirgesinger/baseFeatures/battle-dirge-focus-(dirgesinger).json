At the end of another creature&rsquo;s turn, you can use your reaction to activate a battle dirge. This battle dirge replaces any currently activated battle dirge. Replacing an activated battle dirge does not require expending a use of Mind-Numbing Chant if it has no target yet.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, choose one of the following.</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Your battle dirges no longer require concentration.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Your battle dirges spread like a mind-virus; when a creature fails a save against your battle dirge, or chooses to accept the dirge without making a save, you may immediately target another creature to affect with the same battle dirge. You may do this a total number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, not including the initial dirge.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">You learn an additional battle dirge that does not count against the number of battle dirges you can know. When choosing this battle dirge, you are treated as having 4 more dirgesinger levels for the purpose of meeting its prerequisites. If you change this Battle Dirge Focus, you forget the additional battle dirge.</p></li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">Whenever you gain a dirgesinger level, you may change your Battle Dirge Focus.</p>",
