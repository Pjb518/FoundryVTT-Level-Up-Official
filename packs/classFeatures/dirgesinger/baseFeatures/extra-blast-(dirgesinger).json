This increases to three creatures at 11th level, and four creatures at 17th level. If a creature succeeds on its save against Eldritch Chant, you may target it again with additional uses of Extra Blast.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, when a creature fails its save against Eldritch Chant you may choose to roll one Chant die, expending it. The creature is Confused for a number of rounds equal to the number rolled.</p>",
