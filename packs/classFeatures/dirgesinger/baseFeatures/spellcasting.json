This feature functions as the bard @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.hnco2mcq8qjhysqu]{Spellcasting} feature, with the following changes:</p>\n<p>You may use the bard or warlock spell list when learning cantrips or spells, and all count as dirgesinger spells for you.</p>\n<p>You use Intelligence as your spellcasting ability and to calculate your spell attack modifier and spell save DC.</p>\n<p>You cast spells using an arcane focus. While you are able to speak and not in an area with no sound (such as the radius of a silence spell), you may use your voice as an arcane focus.</p>",
