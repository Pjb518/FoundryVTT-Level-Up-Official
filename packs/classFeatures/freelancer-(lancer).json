Whenever you attempt to make a Persuasion or Deception check you may always use your Strength modifier, and gain expertise when you do so.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rebellious Streak: </strong>Like most lancers you have a reputation for bucking authority and getting the job done, no matter what it takes. You gain expertise on Intimidation checks and may always use your Strength or Constitution when making them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stone Soldier: </strong>Some lancers hold to traditions one might find in a palace guard or a monastery, and hold their cards close to their chest.
