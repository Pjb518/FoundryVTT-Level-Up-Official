When you cast a bard spell, you can replace any vocalized components with speech and any seen components with gestures. Any observers with a passive Insight score equal to or less than your passive Deception score or passive Persuasion score do not see or hear you cast the spell. If you are making a Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion check as part of your speech or gestures, the effects of the spell occur before the check is made.</p><p>Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
