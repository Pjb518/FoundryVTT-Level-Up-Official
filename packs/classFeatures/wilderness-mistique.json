Choose one of the following options:</p><h3><strong>ANSWERING SILENCE</strong></h3><p>When others seek your advice on wilderness matters, they often arrive at the correct conclusion despite (or perhaps because of) the silence with which you respond. When a friendly creature makes a Nature or Survival check while within 5 feet of you, it gains an expertise die.</p><h3><strong>FEARSOME MYSTICISM</strong></h3><p>Your uncanny abilities and single-minded focus can be unnerving to the uninitiated. You gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks against any creature that is neither proficient in Arcana nor casts spells.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>KINDRED SPIRIT</strong></h3><p>You intuitively sense when another wilderness expert is nearby. Your passive Perception increases by 5 to detect hidden or invisible creatures within 30 feet of you, and you instantly detect whether any creature you can see is proficient with Stealth or Survival.</p>",
