You gain the following additional Furious Critical ability which does not count against your furious critical options known: </p><h3><strong>Sundering Blow</strong></h3><p>Your attacks destroy the protective measures of your foes. When you score a critical hit, you may choose to either impose the broken property on your target’s armor or shield (if present) until it is repaired or you reduce the armor class of your target by -2 for one hour if it does not have armor or a shield. A given creature can only be affected by one instance of the -2 armor class reduction at a time.</p><p>In addition, while you are raging, any weapon you wield gains the Breaker property.</p>",
