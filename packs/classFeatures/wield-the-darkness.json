At any time, you can roll your Darkness die and apply the result to one of the following: your AC against one attack made by a creature you can see, an attack or damage roll you make with a weapon, or a Stealth skill check. You can apply your Darkness die even after&nbsp;<span class=\"freelinking-link\">making an attack roll</span>&nbsp;or after the result of a creature&rsquo;s attack roll is declared.</p>\n<p>At 15th level, your Darkness die increases to a d8.</p>",
