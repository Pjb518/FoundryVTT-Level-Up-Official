In addition, if a creature has been dead for less than a year, you may cast this spell to raise them without requiring a material component. Once you have raised a particular creature this way, you may not raise that same creature in this way again, and doing so is exhausting, inflicting penalties as if the target has been dead for over 1 year.</p>",
