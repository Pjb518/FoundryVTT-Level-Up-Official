    "description": "<p>Starting at 17th level, you reach mastery of the way of the fist. When you make an unarmed strike, you score critical hits on a roll of 19–20. If you already have a feature that increases the range of your critical hits, your critical hit range increases by 1 (maximum 17–20). In addition, when you use a bonus action to make an unarmed strike, it deals an additional damage die.</p><p>[[/r 1d4 #d4 die]] [[/r 1d6 #d6 die]] [[/r 1d8 #d8 die]] [[/r 1d10 #d10 die]] [[/r 1d12 #d12 die]]</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by your unarmed strikes, you can spend 3 exertion to make its body and soul be destroyed in an implosion. The target can’t be brought back from the dead, except with a wish spell.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">When you hit a creature with two or more unarmed strikes in the same turn, you can spend 3 exertion to force it to make a Constitution saving throw, dealing one effect from the list below on a failure. For each successful unarmed strike after the second, you can spend 1 exertion to deal one additional effect. For example, if you hit with four unarmed attacks, you can spend 5 exertion to deal three effects. You can’t choose the same effect more than once, and on a successful saving throw all effects are negated.</p><ul><li><p>Deal additional damage equal to twice your martial arts die.</p></li><li><p>The creature is blinded and deafened for 1 minute.</p></li><li><p>The creature is paralyzed for 1 minute. At the beginning of each of its turns, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p></li><li><p>The creature is knocked prone and becomes poisoned for 1 minute.</p></li><li><p>Healing features, spells, and traits have no effect on the creature until the beginning of your next turn.</p></li><li><p>The creature loses a spell slot from its highest available level.</p></li><li><p>The creature loses 6 exertion.</p></li><li><p>The creature can’t use bonus actions, legendary actions, or reactions until the beginning of your next turn.</p></li><li><p>The creature gains a level of fatigue.</p></li></ul>",
