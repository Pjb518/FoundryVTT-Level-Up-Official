Upon doing so, the undead mutters the name (if any) and the creature type (such as Giant or Humanoid - the GM may choose to be more specific, such as stating Orc, or Elf) of the creature that killed it. For the next 24 hours, you or a creature of your choosing gains advantage on the next ability check made regarding the creature (such as a History check to recall something about it, or a Survival check to track it) or attack roll made against it.</p>",
