Until the end of your next turn, that ally can use that trick as if they had prepared it. The trick still uses your trick DC.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">If either of you use the trick, it expends it for both of you. If the ally doesn’t use the trick before the end of your next turn, it remains available for you until you use it.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">At 6th level, the range of this ability increases to 30 feet.</p>",
