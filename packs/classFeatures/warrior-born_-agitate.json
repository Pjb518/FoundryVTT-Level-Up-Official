Make an Intimidation check opposed by the Insight check of a creature you can see and hear within 20 feet. On a success, you subtly press the creature to act out. What exactly the creature does—back away quickly, blurt out something compromising, draw a weapon, look towards a concealed or disguised companion, protectively touch something it is carrying—is at the Narrator’s discretion.</p><p>Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
