    "description": "<p>Beginning at level 6, you can use the flesh and bones of the slain to protect yourself. You may spend 10 minutes performing a ritual over a corpse of your size category or larger to craft a set of corpse armor onto yourself. This grants you a pool of temporary hit points equal to twice your berserker level. When you begin your Rage, you can opt either to end these temporary hit points early (shredding the armor as you do) or allow them to persist into your Rage (unlike normal temporary hit points). You do not benefit from Rage Hit Points while the Graven armor persists. If your Graven Armor temporary hit points are lost while raging, you gain your Rage Hit Points at the start of your next turn.</p><p>This feature comes with downsides. While you have temporary hit points from this feature, the stench of death hangs around you, giving you disadvantage on Persuasion and Deception checks. Attempts to find or track you by smell while you have temporary hit points from this feature are made with advantage.</p><p><br></p>",
