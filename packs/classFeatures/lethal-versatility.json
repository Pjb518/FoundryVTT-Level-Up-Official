Once per turn, when you hit with a weapon attack, you can choose to have the attack do additional damage equal to the number of combat traditions you know at least one maneuver from. Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
