For the next minute, all future instances of the same thing have the exact same result. For example, if one of your companions rolled well on a weapon damage or the numerical effects of a spell, you can Establish Precedent on that weapon or spell, or if you got a roll you like on an expertise die, you can lock in that expertise die result (but only for the check you received the initial expertise on). You can also Establish Precedent on a hostile creature’s spell damage, etc. The Narrator is the final arbiter in edge cases.</p><p>Once you have used this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
