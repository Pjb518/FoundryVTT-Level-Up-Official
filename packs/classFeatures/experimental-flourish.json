Circumstances will dictate what the effect is, but some examples include shoving or imposing the blinded , deafened , grappled , or prone condition, and may also deal damage equal to your Intelligence modifier. Any conditions imposed should seldom last more than one round. Creatures affected can make an Intelligence saving throw to anticipate your trick and avoid the effect.</p>",
