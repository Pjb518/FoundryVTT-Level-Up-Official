You gain the <em>resurrection</em> spell and when you prepare your artificer spells you can prepare it and create a spell invention for it (or forgo it for a modification) in addition to your normal number of prepared spells. This spell counts as a 5th-level artificer spell for you and you can cast it without the usual material components, but a creature you target with it gains the monstrosity type and cannot be targeted by this feature again.</p>",
