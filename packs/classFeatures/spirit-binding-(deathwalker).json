The creature disappears after 1 minute, when you are knocked unconscious, or when it is reduced to 0 hit points.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\">At 15th level, you can have your patron conjure for you either a <strong>Banshee</strong> or a <strong>Wraith</strong> instead.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\">Once you have used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
