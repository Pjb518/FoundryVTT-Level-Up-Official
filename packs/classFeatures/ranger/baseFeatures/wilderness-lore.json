Choose one of the following options:</p><h3 class=\"Indent1\">Big Game Traps</h3><p>Leveraging your skill with snaring small game, you take 10 minutes to set a trap or snare for a creature of Large size or smaller.&nbsp;</p><p>The trap's DC is 8 + your Dexterity bonus + your proficiency bonus. A creature can spot the trap by making a Perception check against the trap's DC.</p><p>Describe the mechanics of your trap to the Narrator, including what triggers it and what happens when triggered. You may use the following examples or work with the Narrator to invent your own.&nbsp;</p><p>When a creature enters the trapped area or interacts with the trapped object it makes a Dexterity&nbsp;saving throw&nbsp;against the trap's DC or triggers the trap.</p><p><strong>Pendulum Trap.</strong>&nbsp;Creatures within 5 feet of the trap are struck by a swinging object that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (determined by the object) equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom bonus.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pit Trap.</strong>&nbsp;The creature falls into a pre-existing pit or hazard that you have concealed.</p><p><strong>Rope Trap.</strong>&nbsp;The creature is either knocked&nbsp;prone&nbsp;or&nbsp;restrained&nbsp;by a net or rope.</p><h3 class=\"Indent1\">Waste Not</h3><p>With 10 minutes work you can scavenge valuable cuts from the corpse of a beast, dragon, monstrosity, or plant that has a CR of 1 or higher and has died within the last hour. If sold to a collector, druid, or other naturalist, this notable component is worth an amount of gold equal to 5 &times; the creature&rsquo;s CR.</p>",
