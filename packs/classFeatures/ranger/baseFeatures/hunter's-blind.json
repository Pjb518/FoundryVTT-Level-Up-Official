The shelter blends in with its surroundings, and as long as no one moves into or out of it, the shelter is indistinguishable from a natural object. It is designed to allow creatures inside to see out but prevent anyone outside from seeing in.&nbsp;</p><p>The shelter is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside, and counts as a haven.</p>",
