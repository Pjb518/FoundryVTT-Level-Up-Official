A creature can spot the trap by making a Perception check against the trap's DC.</p><p>Describe the mechanics of your trap to the Narrator, including what triggers it and what happens when triggered. You may use the following examples or work with the Narrator to invent your own.&nbsp;</p><p>When a creature enters the trapped area or interacts with the trapped object it makes a Dexterity saving throw against the trap's DC or triggers the trap.</p><p><strong>Pendulum Trap.</strong> Creatures within 5 feet of the trap are struck by a swinging object that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (determined by the object) equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom bonus.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pit Trap.</strong> The creature falls into a pre-existing pit or hazard that you have concealed.</p><p><strong>Rope Trap.</strong> The creature is either knocked prone or restrained by a net or rope.</p>",
