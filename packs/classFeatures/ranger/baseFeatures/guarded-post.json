At 13th level choose one of the following options:</p><h3>Defensive Marksman</h3><p>When a hostile creature moves towards you or a companion, you can use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack against it.&nbsp;</p><h3>Hunter's Blind</h3><p>You can spend 10 minutes constructing a natural shelter able to accommodate yourself and up to 9 other creatures of Medium size or smaller. The shelter blends in with its surroundings, and as long as no one moves into or out of it, the shelter is indistinguishable from a natural object. It is designed to allow creatures inside to see out but prevent anyone outside from seeing in.&nbsp;</p><p>The shelter is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside, and counts as a haven.</p>",
