For the next minute, you can direct your focus on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature is unaffected.</p><p>You learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts.</p>",
