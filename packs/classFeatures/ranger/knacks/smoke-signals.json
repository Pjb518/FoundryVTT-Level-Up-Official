On a clear day or night, the signal can be seen up to 10 miles away, or only 1 mile during inclement weather. It takes ten times longer than speaking to convey information in this way, and you may only communicate simple ideas and concepts. Your allies automatically understand the meaning of your signals. Additionally, when you see similar signals from others, you always understand their meaning, regardless if they are your ally or not.</span></p>",
