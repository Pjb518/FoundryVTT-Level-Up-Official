You gain proficiency with Navigator&rsquo;s Tools and Cartographer&rsquo;s Tools.</p><p>In addition, you can draw a quick map in 10 minutes with a DC 15 Cartographer&rsquo;s Tools check. On a success, the map gives those navigating its area (which can be up to 10 miles by 10 miles) advantage on their Survival or Navigator&rsquo;s Tools checks to avoid major hazards, find food and shelter, and pass safely through without becoming lost. On a failed check, your map is an illegible mess and provides no benefit.</p>",
