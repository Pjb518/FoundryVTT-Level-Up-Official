You gain proficiency with navigator&rsquo;s tools, cartographer&rsquo;s tools, and one type of vehicle of your choice. If you are already proficient in any of these tools, you instead gain an expertise die. In addition, you gain the Guide exploration knack, or another exploration knack if you already have it. This does not count against your total exploration knacks known.</span></p>",
