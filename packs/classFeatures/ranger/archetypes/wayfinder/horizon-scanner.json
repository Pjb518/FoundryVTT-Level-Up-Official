You can see through heavily obscured areas as though they were lightly obscured, and through lightly obscured areas as though they were not obscured. If you have darkvision, this feature allows you to see in darkness as though it were bright light within the range of your darkvision, and as though it were dim light beyond that range, although you still can only perceive shades of gray in the dark. If you do not have darkvision, this feature functionally gives you darkvision at unlimited range.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, you have advantage on sight-based Perception checks, and when visibility is clear you can make out fine details at extreme ranges, easily discerning creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.</p>",
