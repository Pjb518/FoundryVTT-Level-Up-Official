Choose one of the following.</p>\n<h2>Evasion</h2>\n<p>When you make a Dexterity saving throw against an effect that deals half damage on a success, you take no damage on a success and half damage on a failure.</p>\n<h2>Adaptive Defense</h2>\n<p>You have an expertise die on saving throws to avoid or escape being grappled, restrained, or knocked prone. In addition, the first time since the start of your turn that you are hit by an attack, you gain a +3 bonus to AC against any further attacks from that specific creature until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h2>Innured Constitution</h2>\n<p>You are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition. This has also bolstered your general constitution, granting an expertise die on all saving throws against disease.</p>",
