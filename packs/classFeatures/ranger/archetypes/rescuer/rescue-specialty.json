Choose one of the following options:</p>\n<h2>Never Lost</h2>\n<p>The size of the expertise die granted by your Familiar Terrain feature increases by one step, to a maximum of 1d10. In addition, as long as you are on a plane you have spent at least a week on, you always know which way is north, and you always know how much time you have until sunset.</p>\n<h2>Rescuer&rsquo;s Instincts</h2>\n<p>You are especially good at finding those who need your help. You gain an expertise die on Perception and Investigation checks to find creatures that are injured or in distress. If a creature wants to be found or is unconscious, you also make these checks withadvantage.</p>\n<h2>Trustworthy and Compassionate</h2>\n<p>Your good intentions, when genuine, are self-evident. When you are telling the truth, creatures automatically succeed on Insight checks to determine your honesty. In addition, you have advantage on Persuasion checks to convince other creatures to help you help someone else.</p>",
