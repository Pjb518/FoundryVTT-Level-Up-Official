If they fail a Wisdom saving throw against your trick DC, until the end of your turn when you move, you can move them an equal distance, keeping them within your melee reach the whole time. Their movement doesnâ€™t provoke opportunity attacks, and if you would move them into a space that would cause them damage, they can choose to stop outside it.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">After you use this feature, you cannot use it against the same creature again until you finish a short rest.</p>",
