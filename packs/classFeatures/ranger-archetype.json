    "description": "<p>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that embodies your purpose as a ranger. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.</p><p>Some ranger archetypes can grant spells. If you are using a ranger archetype that grants spells, you learn to innately cast those spells once each between long rests using material components found in nature (such as a handful of dry leaves or loose gravel instead of the tiny silver bell for the alarm spell). The spells that you cast in this way are always cast using the lowest spell level. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p><p>When you reach 9th level in this class you gain a second use of your 1st-level ranger spell between long rests.</p><p>When you reach 17th level in this class you gain a second use of your 2nd-level ranger spell between long rests.</p>",
