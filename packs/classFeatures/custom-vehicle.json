		"description": "<p>At 3rd level you gain the ability to create your own custom personal vehicle, a marvel of engineering that you constantly improve upon and redesign. Your custom vehicle is a land vehicle with statistics as shown on Table: Engineer&rsquo;s vehicle.</p>\n<p>You can create this custom vehicle over the course of 8 hours of uninterrupted work. This vehicle is unique and its exact appearance is up to you. Your custom vehicle requires your regular care, and if you attempt to create another vehicle using this feature any vehicles you&rsquo;ve previously constructed in this way fall apart into useless scrap. So long as you have access to your tools of artifice, you can restore your custom vehicle to full hit points and remove any malfunctions during a long rest.</p>\n<p>For more detailed information regarding vehicles, see <em>Chapter 4: Equipment in the Adventurer&rsquo;s Guide</em>.</p>\n<p>Whenever you finish a long rest, you can make modifications to your custom vehicle by expending infusion uses. These modifications only remain functional due to your infusions, and you can maintain these modifications as if they were infused items. Any modifications you fail to maintain are removed whenever you finish a long rest. You can install any of the following modifications at the cost of 1 infusion each.</p>\n<p><strong>Table: Engineer's Vehicle</strong></p>\n<table style=\"width: 100%;\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 22.6684%;\"><col style=\"width: 24.8122%;\"><col style=\"width: 18.2171%;\"><col style=\"width: 34.1085%;\"></colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Vehicle</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Size*</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">AC</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">HP</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Custom Vehicle</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Medium or Large</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">10 + int mode</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">10 + your Artificer level x 5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width: 100%; height: 33.5938px;\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 23.6434%;\"><col style=\"width: 20.5426%;\"><col style=\"width: 18.6047%;\"><col style=\"width: 15.7119%;\"><col style=\"width: 21.4974%;\"></colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">Speed</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">Crew</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">Cost</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">Supply</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">Special</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">30ft or 3mph</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">10gp</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">10</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">Personal</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em>* The damage caused by collisions with Medium vehicles is 2d6.</em></p>\n<h3>Armor Plating</h3>\n<p>Your custom vehicle&rsquo;s AC increases by 2.</p>\n<h3>All-Terrain</h3>\n<p>Your custom vehicle ignores difficult terrain.</p>\n<h3>Chemical Boosters</h3>\n<p>While driving your vehicle, you can use a bonus action to increase its speed by 30 feet for 1 minute. Once the vehicle&rsquo;s speed is increased in this way it cannot benefit from this modification again until you finish a long rest maintaining or reinstalling this modification.</p>\n<h3>Enhanced Brakes</h3>\n<p>Your custom vehicle can take the Stop action even if it has momentum. When it stops in this way it loses momentum.</p>\n<h3>Integrated Spell Invention</h3>\n<p>When you prepare your spell inventions and modifications to your custom vehicle, you may choose to integrate a spell invention into it. You may only cast spells using integrated spell inventions while you are driving your custom vehicle. If an integrated spell invention would burn out and be destroyed, instead your custom vehicle suffers the integrity malfunction (the integrity malfunction can be suffered multiple times). Any integrated spell inventionsare destroyed if your custom vehicle is destroyed.</p>\n<h3>Mechanical Legs</h3>\n<p>Your custom vehicle gains a climb speed of 30 feet or 3 miles per hour.</p>\n<h3>Motorized Wheels</h3>\n<p>Your custom vehicle&rsquo;s Speed increases to 50 feet or 5 miles per hour.</p>\n<h3>Passenger Seat</h3>\n<p>Your custom vehicle loses its personal property. It can carry you plus one Medium sized or smaller passenger.</p>\n<h3>Ramming</h3>\n<p>Whenever a collision occurs with your custom vehicle, the damage it takes is reduced by 1d6, and damage dealt to other impacted objects and vehicles is increased by 2d6.</p>\n<h3>Seaworthy</h3>\n<p>Your custom vehicle becomes a water vehicle (with a swim speed of 30 feet or 3 miles per hour) in addition to being a land vehicle. When making checks for your custom vehicle, treat it as a water vehicle while it travels over water and as a land vehicle when it travels overland.</p>\n<h3>Shielded Cockpit</h3>\n<p>While driving your custom vehicle, you gain the benefits of half cover.</p>",
