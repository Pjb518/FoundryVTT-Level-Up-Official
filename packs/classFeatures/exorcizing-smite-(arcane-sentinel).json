If it is not native to the plane it currently occupies, it returns to its home plane for one minute, then reappears in the space it previously occupied or the nearest available safe space if its former space is occupied. </p><p>If the creature fails its save by 5 or more, it it banished for a year instead, and is unable to return to the plane it was banished from by means less powerful than a wish spell. If the creature is undead, it is sent to its final judgment instead of being banished for a year.</p>",
