You learn an additional battle hymn chosen from Table: Battle Hymns, counting your bard level as double for the purposes of which battle hymns you meet the prerequisites for. This battle hymn does not count against your number of battle hymns known. When you reach 8th level, you may change one of your battle hymns for a new Victorious Hymn.</p>",
