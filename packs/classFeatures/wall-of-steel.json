While wielding one of your Fencer’s Arsenal weapons, when you use your reaction to perform a parry, opportunity attack, or a combat maneuver, you can use this feature to do so without expending your reaction, up to a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus each round. You pay exertion costs normally, and any of these actions after the first without an exertion cost instead costs 1 exertion.&nbsp;</p><p>If you use a reaction to perform any other task (such as casting a spell), you cannot use this feature until the beginning of your next turn; likewise, if you use this feature you cannot use your reaction other than to perform a parry, opportunity attack, or combat maneuver until the beginning of your next turn.</p><p></p>",
