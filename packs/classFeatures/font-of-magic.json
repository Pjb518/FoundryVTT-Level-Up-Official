Up until now, it’s just been something abstract, maybe hardly understood, but now you can use it in a precise manner to fuel your magics. It grants you a new resource in the form of Sorcery Points, as well as a way to use them.</p><h3>Sorcery Points</h3><p>You have 2 Sorcery Points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You can never have more Sorcery Points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent Sorcery Points when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Flexible Casting</h3><p>You can use your Sorcery Points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional Sorcery Points.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conversion. </strong>You can transform unexpended Sorcery Points into one spell slot, or vice versa, as a bonus action. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level, or the value of sacrificing a spell slot for Sorcery Points.&nbsp;You cannot convert spells of 6th-level or higher.</p>",
