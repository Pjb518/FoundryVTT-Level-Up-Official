    "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Also at 17th level, when you finish a long rest, you can spend a use of channel divinity to imbue a number of allies equal to your Wisdom modifier with divine power. For each affected creature, choose a cantrip you know and three 1st-level spells you know. None of the affected spells can do damage or impose conditions or other harmful effects. A chosen creature can use the granted cantrip at will as if they knew it normally and can use any combination of the three granted spells a total of three times. Creatures may use their choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as their spellcasting ability for the granted spells. The imbuement ends when you begin a long rest.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>!Foundry Note: Set uses to channel divinity resource, then delete this suggestion</em></p>",
