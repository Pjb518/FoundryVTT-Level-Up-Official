Judge others based on their actions now, not then.</li><li><strong>Learn From Mistakes.</strong> Never commit the same mistakes. Draw nowledge from every failure. Remind others that defeat should be a turning point, not a dead end.</li><li><strong>Choose Your Own Path.</strong> Allow no one, not even deities, to decide your destiny for you. Grab fate by the neck.</li><li><strong>Embrace Duty.</strong> Choose the life of a hero. Defend the weak, punish the guilty.</li></ul>",
