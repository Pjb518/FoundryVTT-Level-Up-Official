    "description": "<p>With spear and shield, long-hafted axe, or even just a single sword, lancers rush across the field of battle, striking down foes with nearby allies in eager formation. When away from other lancers, they’re often seen as loners on the battlefield as they rush and strike and feint and retreat. So renowned are they, that their name describes a role in tales of the protagonist who seeks to lead and bucks authority.</p><p></p><p><strong>Creating a Lancer</strong></p><p>Lancer characters are more than just running around a battlefield with a polearm, even if that’s viewed as their primary mechanical distinction. They’re also&nbsp; focused, devoted, and curious. The reason they often buck against authority in literature and media is definitely something to explore.</p><p><br><strong>CLASS FEATURES</strong></p><p>As a Lancer you gain the following class features.</p><h3><strong>Hit Points</strong></h3><p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per Lancer level</p><p><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier</p><p><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per Lancer level after 1st</p><p></p><h3><strong>Proficiencies</strong></h3><p><strong>Armor:</strong> Light Armor, Medium Armor, Shields</p><p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple Weapons, Martial Weapons, Lance, Net</p><p><strong>Tools:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Dexterity, Charisma</p><p><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose three from Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Perception, and Stealth</p><p></p><p><strong>Equipment</strong></p><p>You begin the game with 110 gold which you can spend on your character’s starting weapons, armor, and adventuring gear.
