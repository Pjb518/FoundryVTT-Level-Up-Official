If one of your allies that you’re aware died in the past round, you can use your action to entreat them to hold on. If you do, they briefly return to life at 0 hit points, are stable, and for the next minute cannot be required to make death saving throws from taking damage. If they remain at 0 hit points at the end of one minute, they actually die.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">At the Narrator’s discretion, some actions can kill a helpless creature despite this ability, such as decapitation or falling in lava.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>",
