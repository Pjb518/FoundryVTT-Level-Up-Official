    "description": "<p>At 20th level, you become an extension of nature. Your Wild Shape has no duration. In addition, when you cast a druid spell you do not need seen or vocalized components, or any material components that have no cost or aren’t consumed by the casting. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and while using Wild Shape.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">You also learn to tap into the intricate ebb and flow of life around you and how to divert it as you see fit. You may cast the spells <strong>True Ressurection</strong> and<em> </em><strong>Power Word</strong>: <strong>Kill </strong>without expending a spell slot and without any material components. Once you cast either spell in this way, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">Finally, you can turn nature in its rawest elements into deadly weapons no matter your form. See the other entries.</p><p></p>",
