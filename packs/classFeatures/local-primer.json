The book is obviously magical and clearly not a solid object, cannot be damaged or taken from you, and persists until you dismiss it (no action required) or leave the bounds of the settlement. The book sheds bright light to a range of 5 feet and dim light to a range of 15 feet.</p><p>The amount of time it takes to read this book for a given community is up to the Narrator, but as an action, you can learn any of the following: </p><ul><li><p>Who is officially in charge of the area.</p></li><li><p>A brief summary of what sorts of behavior will win you favor or get you into trouble.</p></li><li><p>What deviations from common legal norms exist, if any. For example: if theft is legal here or wearing green clothing is not.</p></li><li><p>What rights you have in the settlement, if any.</p></li></ul><p>You may use this feature at will.</p>",
