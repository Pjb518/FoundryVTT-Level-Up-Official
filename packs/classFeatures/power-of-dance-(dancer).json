If you cast a spell has vocalized components you can ignore those components as long as you are capable of performing a seen component, and a spell cast in this way gains a seen component if it does not already have one; if you cast a spell that requires a target to hear you, you can use it on any target that can see you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\">Furthermore, while using the Visual art specialty as your spell focus if you make a spell attack roll and miss or force a creature to make a saving throw and they succeed you can expend a use of bardic inspiration as a reaction to make a performance check, applying the dance specialty if you have it.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>You can replace your spell attack roll or your spell save DC with the result of the check, potentially altering the result of the roll.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span>You can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>",
