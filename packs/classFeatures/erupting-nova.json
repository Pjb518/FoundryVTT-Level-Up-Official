You can cast two spells simultaneously, spending spell slots for each, so long as both spells have a casting time of 1 action, the sum of their levels is less than 6th-level, and neither spell requires concentration. When you do so, make a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 + the sum of the spells’ levels). On a failure, you waste your action (but not any spell slots) and both spells are removed from your spell list until you finish a long rest. </p>",
