		"description": "<p>At 18th level you accomplishes the ultimate feat of alchemy: the creation of a philosopher's stone. Using this stone allows you to do the following:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Lead to Gold</h2>\n<p>You may turn any amount of a less valuable metal into an equivalent amount of gold.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Elixir of Youth</h2>\n<p>Once per year you may use your philosopher's stone to brew an elixir of youth, expending an additional 10,000 gp worth of materials when doing so and taking 8 hours. When a creature takes this elixir, they do not age during the next year, are immune to disease and magical aging, and that year does not count towards the creature's maximum lifespan. The first time they do so it also reduces them to their \"prime physical age\", mid twenties for a human or equivalent for other heritages. It may also be used as a reusable spell component that is not consumed for all resurrection spells, and a creature holding it may expend a hit die to replicate the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.0k5zymq9q95l8jwa]{Revivify}, @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.9zhsri19dkhm9mcf]{Raise Dead}, and @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.zontlhypt3b5gk6z]{Resurrection} spells each once per year, suffering the normal penalties from the spells if appropriate.</p>",
