In addition, such is your insight into language, spoken or otherwise, that you can communicate short, simple concepts with any intelligent creature even if you don't share a language: enough for a greeting, farewell, warning of danger, conveying the need for help of some sort, or insulting someone. The Narrator is the ultimate arbiter of what you are capable of communicating. At scholar level 6 or higher, you may instead spend a hit die to replicate the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.ef9fuzf8xcja2p7c]{Tongues} spell on yourself.</p>",
