By spending an hour asking around, you can automatically find who has authority over a particular aspect of a community&rsquo;s life such as, but not limited to, who the local top law enforcer is, who is in charge of infrastructure, who controls the local budget, and so on. Once you have found such an individual, you gain an expertise die to Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion checks to convince them to help you or your community.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Your prestige rating also increases by 2 and can never be lower than 3.</p>",
