		"description": "<p>Beginning at 6th level, you gain the ability to mark your foes with a supernatural brand.</p><p>As a bonus action, choose a creature within 60 feet you can see. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature has a glowing symbol branded onto its hand, face, forehead, or other obvious location. While the brand persists, whenever the creature takes damage, it takes 1d4 points of psychic damage and must make another Charisma save or be rattled until the end of its next turn, and it also cannot benefit from resting in sanctuaries. The mark lasts for a number of days equal to your proficiency bonus or until you dismiss it (no action required). A creature that succeeds on its save takes 1d6 psychic damage, is rattled until the end of its next turn, and is immune to your Mark of the Pariah for 24 hours.</p><p>Once you have used this ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
