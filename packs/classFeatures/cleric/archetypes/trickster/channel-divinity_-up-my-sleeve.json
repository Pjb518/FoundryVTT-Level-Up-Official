If the object is a food item, it instantly loses its nourishing qualities and if it is a body, it can never be restored to life. The object remains in the extradimensional space for a maximum number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus, after which it appears at your feet. At any time before then, you may use your reaction to retrieve the object in response to whatever you wish. It either appears at your feet or in your hands as you choose.</p>",
