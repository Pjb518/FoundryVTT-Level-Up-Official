You gain the services of an @UUID[Compendium.a5e-mmv2.mmv2-monsters.Actor.u80Ixyc9wGtSJTJj]{Acolyte Drake} which faithfully serves you as a mount, advisor, and companion in combat. If it is killed, it vanishes for a week as it reforms in the upper planes and then returns to your service. You must treat the drake with proper respect and regard; it is subordinate to you but is not a punching bag, slave, or cannon fodder and may choose to leave your service if mistreated. If this happens, the Narrator will determine what, if anything, may be done to regain its services or secure the services of a different acolyte drake.</p>",
