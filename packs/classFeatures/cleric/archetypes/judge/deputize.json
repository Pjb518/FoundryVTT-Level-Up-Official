A creature asking an unapproved question may try again (subject only to your patience), or you may simply deny it access to the benefits of this ability. The ability takes effect for all selected creatures once these conflicts have been resolved.</p><p>In addition, you and the affected creatures all gain a bonus to AC and saving throws equal to half your proficiency bonus for the duration of the effect.</p>",
