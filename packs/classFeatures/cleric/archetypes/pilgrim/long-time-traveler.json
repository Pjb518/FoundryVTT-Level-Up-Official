If you already have a feature that increases the range of your critical successes, your critical success range increases by 1 (maximum 17&ndash;20). Whenever you would roll on an Ability Check Critical Success table, roll twice and choose one of the results. If both rolls are identical, reroll one of them.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, whenever you gain a sign of faith, you may instead choose an adventuring trick from the bard class or an exploration knack from the ranger class, substituting your cleric level for any level prerequisites.</p>",
