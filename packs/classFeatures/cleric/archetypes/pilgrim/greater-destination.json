Whenever a creature within 30 feet of you gains inspiration from their destiny&rsquo;s source of inspiration, you gain inspiration as well if you do not already have it. Once you have gained inspiration in this way, you cannot gain it again from the same creature until you have completed a long rest.</p>",
