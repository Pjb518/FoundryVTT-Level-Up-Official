Choose one of the following options:</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Devoted Wanderer</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The heavens smile upon your sacrifices. When you take the Pray journey activity, critical failures count as failures, failures become successes, successes become critical successes, and critical successes also grant a point of favor as per the Religious Devotion downtime activity. (Points of favor gained in this way are immediately lost if you act against the interests or philosophies of the entities you connected with using the Pray journey activity.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, you can always choose to use Religion when performing the Religious Devotion downtime activity and have advantage on checks to do so.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Greater Destination</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You have come to understand your literal travels as a reflection of a deeper, spiritual journey that all travel together. Whenever a creature within 30 feet of you gains inspiration from their destiny&rsquo;s source of inspiration, you gain inspiration as well if you do not already have it. Once you have gained inspiration in this way, you cannot gain it again from the same creature until you have completed a long rest.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Long-Time Traveler</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Your travels have led you to experience a little bit of everything. You score a critical success on ability checks on a roll of 19&ndash;20. If you already have a feature that increases the range of your critical successes, your critical success range increases by 1 (maximum 17&ndash;20). Whenever you would roll on an Ability Check Critical Success table, roll twice and choose one of the results. If both rolls are identical, reroll one of them.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, whenever you gain a sign of faith, you may instead choose an adventuring trick from the bard class or an exploration knack from the ranger class, substituting your cleric level for any level prerequisites.</p>",
