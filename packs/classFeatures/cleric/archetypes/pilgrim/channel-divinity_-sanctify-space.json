They are also incapable of charming, frightening, or possessing another creature within the area. Any such effects end on a creature that enters the area. When casting, you may exclude one or more creature types from this effect.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you may anchor additional magical effects to the area. Choose&nbsp;<strong>three effects</strong> from the list below (the Narrator may also offer specific effects).</p>\n<p>Some effects apply to creatures. You may choose to affect all creatures, creatures of a specific type, or those that follow a specific leader or deity. Creatures make a Charisma saving throw when the spell is cast, when they enter the area for the first time on a turn, or if they end their turn within the area. On a successful save, a creature is immune to the effect until it leaves the area.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Courage:</strong> Creatures in the area cannot be frightened.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Darkness:</strong> The area is filled by darkness, and normal light sources or sources from a lower level spell slot are smothered within it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Daylight:</strong> The area is filled with bright light, dispelling magical darkness created by spells of a lower level spell slot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Energy Protection:</strong> Creatures in the area gain resistance against a damage type of your choice (excepting bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Energy Vulnerability:</strong> Creatures in the area gain vulnerability against a damage type of your choice (excepting bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Everlasting Rest:</strong> Dead bodies laid to rest in the area cannot be turned into undead by any means.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Extradimensional Interference:</strong> Extradimensional movement or travel is blocked to and from the area, including all teleportation effects.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fear</strong>: Creatures are frightened while within the area.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Silence: </strong>No sound can enter or emanate from the area.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tongues: </strong>Creatures within the area can freely communicate with one another whether they share a language or not.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>"
