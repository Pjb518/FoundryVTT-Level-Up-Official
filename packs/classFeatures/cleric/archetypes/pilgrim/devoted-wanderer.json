When you take the Pray journey activity, critical failures count as failures, failures become successes, successes become critical successes, and critical successes also grant a point of favor as per the Religious Devotion downtime activity. (Points of favor gained in this way are immediately lost if you act against the interests or philosophies of the entities you connected with using the Pray journey activity.)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, you can always choose to use Religion when performing the Religious Devotion downtime activity and have advantage on checks to do so.</p>",
