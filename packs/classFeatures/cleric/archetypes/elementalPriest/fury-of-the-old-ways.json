In addition, you can infuse divine power into a weapon attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage, the type of which is the same as you deal with Channel Divinity: Elemental Intervention. Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Furious Spellcraft</strong></h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Damage you deal with Cleric cantrips increases by your Wisdom modifier. You also learn a bonus cantrip chosen from your elemental school (from any class&rsquo;s spell list).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
