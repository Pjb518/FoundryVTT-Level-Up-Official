When you cast a spell from your archetype spell list of 1st-level or higher, choose a number of targets up to the spell&rsquo;s level, chosen from yourself and friendly creatures you can see or hear within thirty feet of you. Distribute a number of elemental divination dice among these targets totalling the spell&rsquo;s level.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Creatures can spend your elemental divination dice to add an expertise die on any roll they make. If a creature is subject to your elemental divination more than once, their remaining elemental divination dice stack with the new. All of a character&rsquo;s elemental divination dice disappear 1 minute after the last one they received.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
