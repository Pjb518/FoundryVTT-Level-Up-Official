While doing so, you are blind to your own surroundings and see through the eyes of a creature you name. As long as the creature is alive and on the same plane of existence, you recall a still image of its surroundings exactly as it saw them in a single moment. If the creature is dead, blinded, unconscious, or protected from divination magic this feature has no effect.</p>",
