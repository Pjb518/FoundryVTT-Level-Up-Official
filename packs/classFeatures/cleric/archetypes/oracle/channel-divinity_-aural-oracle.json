		"description": "<p>At 6th level, you are able to use your @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.s4iiatrup3e3virw]{Channel Divinity} to see and hear through the eyes of another for 1 minute. When using this feature, you become blinded and deafened to your surroundings and sense through a creature you name. As long as the creature is alive and on the same plane of existence, it makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you can see what it sees and hear what it hears. An unconscious creature automatically fails its save, but only hears (it sees nothing). You cannot see through the eyes of a blinded creature, or hear through the ears of a deafened creature. If the creature is dead or protected from divination magic this feature has no effect. On a successful save, a creature is immune to this feature for 24 hours.</p>",
