		"description": "<p>You come from a religious order that creates some kind of foodstuff as part of monastic practice. Common variations on this theme are bread, cheese, beer, and wine, but it can be almost anything. You gain proficiency with brewer&rsquo;s supplies and cook&rsquo;s tools. In addition, your order has carefully created and maintained a small collection of secret recipes. Trade goods you produce with cook&rsquo;s tools or brewer&rsquo;s supplies have double their usual value. Finally, your culinary knowledge is refined enough that you can identify spices and other foodstuffs by appearance and smell and can tell cheap or fake imitations from the genuine article without the need for an ability check.</p>",
