You gain proficiency with calligrapher&rsquo;s tools.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, when writing religious texts you can encode hidden meanings or messages into the text. The apparent text (which usually contains more standard religious instruction and wisdom) must be at least four times longer than the hidden message.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other creatures who are strongly affiliated with your faith such as other clerics of the same tradition or the supernatural servants of your higher power can find and read the message automatically with no check required, and you can do the same with similarly-hidden wisdom or messages from them.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Creatures from outside your faith or tradition can spend a minute to make a Religion check against your spell save DC to detect the presence of a hidden message, and are able to read the hidden message if they succeed by 5 or more.</p>",
