    "description": "<p>At 9th level, you bring the true presence of your ideals wherever you go. Choose one of the following.</p><h2>Cosmic Idealist</h2><p>Your moral compass aligns with the transcendent forces of the multiverse. Choose Chaotic, Evil, Good, Lawful, or one of the following: Chaotic and Evil, Chaotic and Good, Lawful and Evil, or Lawful and Good. You gain the chosen alignment trait or alignment traits. You can identify creatures that have the same alignment traits as you, and you have advantage when making Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma checks against them.</p><p>Additionally, you do not suffer negative effects from being on a plane with which you share an alignment trait.</p><h2>Eyes of the Heart</h2><p>You have a way of really seeing folk&rsquo;s inner character. When you succeed on a contested Insight check, if the opposing creature&rsquo;s Charisma score is equal to or less than your spell save DC, for the next 24 hours you do not need to make any further checks to recognize whenever that creature is lying, telling the truth, or excluding information.</p><h2>Spiritual Salve</h2><p>Your spiritual mindset has given you unique insights that can help you and your companions endure hardships. Your constant encouragements and proverbs allow allies within 30 feet of you to reroll a Constitution check or saving throw that they fail. If they do so, they must use the new roll. This feature cannot be used on saving throws made to maintain concentration on a spell. Once a creature has used your Spiritual Salve to make a reroll, it cannot do so again until it has finished a long rest.</p>",
