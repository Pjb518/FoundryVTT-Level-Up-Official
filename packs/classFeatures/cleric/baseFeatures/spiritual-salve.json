Your constant encouragements and proverbs allow allies within 30 feet of you to reroll a Constitution check or saving throw that they fail. If they do so, they must use the new roll. This feature cannot be used on saving throws made to maintain concentration on a spell. Once a creature has used your Spiritual Salve to make a reroll, it cannot do so again until it has finished a long rest.</p>",
