Each time you gain Empowered Turning, choose one of the following:</p><h2>Command Undead</h2><p>If you choose, creatures you turn instead regard you as their master for the duration. While they are under this effect, you may use your action to issue simple commands (no more than a sentence or two) which they are compelled to obey. They will not take any action that is obviously harmful to them, and so will not leap from a great height, jump onto a sword, or purposefully self-inflict any damage. They follow the command until you issue a new one.</p><h2>Destroy Undead</h2><p>Creatures turned by you of CR 1/2 or less are immediately destroyed, transformed into dust by a blinding flash of light. You can select this option multiple times. Each time you choose it, you are able to destroy more powerful creatures, progressing to CR 1, CR 2, CR 3, and then CR 4 each subsequent time you select this option.</p><h2>Turn Ideology</h2><p>Choose one of the following: Chaotic, Evil, Good, or Lawful. When you use Turn Undead, you can also choose to affect creatures with the chosen alignment trait. You can select this option multiple times.</p><h2>Turn Supernatural</h2><p>Choose a creature type from celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend. When you use Turn Undead, you can also choose to affect creatures of that type. You can select this option multiple times.</p>",
