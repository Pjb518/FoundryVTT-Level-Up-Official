		"description": "<p>At 2nd level you can magically summon a spiritual vine that can strike and grab your foes. As a bonus action, you create a 10-foot long vine at a point you can see within 60 feet. The vine lasts for 1 minute, until you dismiss it as a bonus action, or until you use this feature to create another vine. When you create the vine, you can make a melee spell attack against one target within 10 feet of it. On a hit the target takes 1d6 force damage, and it must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure the target is restrained by the vine (escape DC equal to your spell save DC). </p><p>When you reach 10th level in this class, the damage increases to 2d6. </p><p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the vine up to 30 feet and repeat the attack, or if a creature is currently restrained by the vine you may move the vine and the restrained creature 10 feet in any direction.</p>",
