While carrying a willing creature of size Medium or smaller, you may treat their weight as halved for a number of hours equal to your Strength modifier between the ends of each long rest, provided you are not currently encumbered or carrying more than one bulky item on your person. Additionally, you gain an expertise die to checks and saving throws made to free your allies from grapples and restraints caused by non-creatures (such as manacles or the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.cvrja4dkrr0zoerp]{Entangle} spell).</span></p>",
