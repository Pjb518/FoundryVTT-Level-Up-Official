Choose one of the following options:</p>\n<h2>Down But Not Out</h2>\n<p>If they are not killed outright, friendly creatures within range of your Commanding Presence ability automatically stabilize when they drop to 0 hit points. This ability only works while you are alive.</p>\n<h2>Unbreakable</h2>\n<p>If you would be reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you instead drop to 1 hit point and may use your reaction to make a single weapon attack against the source of the damage that felled you. If this counterattack is a critical hit, you immediately heal to half of your maximum hit points. Once you have used this ability, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
