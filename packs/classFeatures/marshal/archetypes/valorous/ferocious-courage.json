		"description": "<p>At 3rd level when you take this archetype, your own courage inspires those around you to greater feats of valor and battlefield prowess, clearing their minds and hardening their resolve. Choose one of the following options: </p><h3><strong>Stand Fast</strong></h3><p>Friendly creatures within range of your Commanding Presence make their saving throws against effects that would cause them to become confused, frightened or rattled with advantage. In addition, if a creature so affected makes such a saving throw and <em>both</em> dice would have been sufficient to make the save, their attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of psychic damage to the source of the effect for the next 10 minutes.</p><h3><strong>Shake It Off</strong></h3><p>If a friendly creature within the range of your Commanding Presence feature deals damage to the source of an effect that has caused it to become confused, frightened, or rattled, it gains an additional free saving throw against the effect, ending it on a success. If the creature successfully saves, it also regains hit points equal to 1d4+your Charisma modifier.</p>",
