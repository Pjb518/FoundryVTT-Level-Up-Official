Choose one of the following options: </p><h3><strong>No Quarter</strong></h3><p>If a creature is bloodied, weapon attacks from you and friendly creatures within the range of your Commanding Presence ability do additional damage to it equal to your Charisma modifier.</p><h3><strong>No Mercy</strong></h3><p>Whenever you or a friendly creature within the range of your Commanding Presence makes a successful weapon attack against a creature that has been marked with your Mark Foe feature, the attack deals 1d4 ongoing damage for one minute or until the creature or one of its allies spends an action to stanch the wound. A target can only suffer one instance of this ability from any given creature at a time. Multiple hits from the same creature reset the duration of the ongoing damage, but do not increase the amount of it.</p>",
