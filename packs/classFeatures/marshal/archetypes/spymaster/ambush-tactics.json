Once per turn when an affected creature hits with an attack and has advantage on the attack roll, the attack deals an additional 1d6 damage. You may select a new batch of creatures by spending another action. The effect persists for one minute. Once you have used this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
