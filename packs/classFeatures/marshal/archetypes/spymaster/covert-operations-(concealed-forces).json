For one hour, as long as those creatures do not make attacks or cast spells with seen components, those creatures gain advantage on all checks to avoid notice or to appear not out-of-place. As long as these creatures share a language, they gain advantage on Deception checks to conceal messages that they sign to one another.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you have used this feature, you may not use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
