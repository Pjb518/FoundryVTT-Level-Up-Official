You acquire a masterwork weapon of that type that you can conjure into your empty hand as an action. It is always considered to have the flamboyant property. This is a magical weapon (it overcomes resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage). Your Weapon of Dread disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.</p>",
