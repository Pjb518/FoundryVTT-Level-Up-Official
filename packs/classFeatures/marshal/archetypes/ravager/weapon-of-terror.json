		"description": "<p>At 7th level, your @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.v1veq4yf1kt1boh3]{Weapon of Dread} improves, allowing the weapon to absorb the essence of other magical weapons. As an hour-long ritual, you may transfer the properties of a magical weapon in your possession to your Weapon of Dread. Your Weapon of Dread gains the magical properties of that weapon, and the original becomes a mundane weapon of its type.</p>\n<p>You may only absorb the essence of one magic weapon at a time with this feature. If you replace one set of properties with another, the once-magic item whose properties you had previously transferred immediately reacquires them (even if it&rsquo;s on another plane). If the disenchanted weapon has been destroyed, it magically re-forms in a space adjacent to you as your Weapon of Dread acquires its new properties.</p>",
