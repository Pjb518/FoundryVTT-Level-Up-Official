Choose two of the following benefits: </p><h3><strong>Burning Gaze</strong> </h3><p>A mere look from you can set creatures and structures aflame. As a bonus action, you may select a number of targets up to your Charisma modifier you can see within 120 feet. They all take 1d6 fire damage and 1d6 ongoing fire damage until a creature spends an action to extinguish the flames.</p><h3><strong>Unholy Resilience</strong> </h3><p>You are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition. You also have resistance to necrotic damage and to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</p><h3><strong>Master of Fear </strong></h3><p>You may now use Sower of Terror at will, and as a bonus action.</p><h3><strong>Aura of Slaughter </strong></h3><p>The bonus damage of Bloodthirsty increases to 1d8 necrotic damage, and enemy creatures within your Commanding Presence have disadvantage on death saving throws.</p>",
