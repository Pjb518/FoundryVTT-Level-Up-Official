You gain proficiency with the Religion skill and with the Tempered Iron combat tradition. </p><p>You also gain a certain degree of religious rank. While traveling, you and a number of companions equal to your proficiency bonus may stay at a temple or shrine of your faith for free for up to a week, enjoying a moderate lifestyle while staying there. You also enjoy a certain amount of rank, which may be ceremonial or hierarchical, depending on the nature of your organization. In either case, you treat your prestige score as 1 level higher than normal when dealing with members of your faith or those friendly to it.</p>",
