				"description": "<p>This spell cannot be cast in sunlight. You reanimate the targets as undead and transform them into ghouls under your control.</p><p>While it is within 120 feet you can use a bonus action to mentally command the undead. When you command multiple undead using this spell, you must give them all the same command. You may decide the action the undead takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area. If not given a command, the undead only defends itself. The undead continues to follow a command until its task is complete.</p><p>The undead is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any commands. You must cast this spell on the undead before the spell ends to maintain control of it for another 24 hours. Casting the spell in this way reasserts control over up to 3 undead you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> You create or reassert control over one additional ghoul for each slot level above 6th. Alternatively, when using an 8th-level spell slot you create or reassert control over 2 ghasts or wights, or when using a 9th-level spell slot you create or reassert control over 3 ghasts or wights, or 2 mummies. When commanding more than 3 undead they make group attack rolls (see page 454 in Chapter 8: Combat).</p>",
