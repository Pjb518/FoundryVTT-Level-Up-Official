When you first meet an NPC, you can choose to remain silent and speak through nonvisual cues â€” scrunching your brows, pursing your&nbsp;lips, narrowing your eyes, slowly leaning ever so slightly forward, hunching your shoulders, and so on. As long as you remain silent for 1 minute, the NPC has a CR lower than your level, and it remains within sight of you for the duration, it acts as if you succeeded on an Intimidation check.</p><p>In addition, you gain an expertise die on Insight checks.</p>",
