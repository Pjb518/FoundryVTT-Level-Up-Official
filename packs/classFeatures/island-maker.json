    "description": "<p>At 20th level, you can create a new island where one did not previously exist. To do so, you must select an area of open sea at least 2 miles from any existing landmass. You must then spend a week’s worth of 8-hour days performing a magical ritual over the area, during which time a new volcanic vent opens and creates a new island with an area of 1d4+1 square miles. The surface is covered in rich volcanic soil that any plants native to the surrounding area will thrive in, and the process also magically stocks the surrounding waters with schools of fish suitable for fishing. Once you have used this ability, you cannot do so again for a year. Additionally, once you have used this ability 1d6 times, you must undertake some great task (Narrator’s discretion) to regain the ability to do so another 1d6 times.</p>",
