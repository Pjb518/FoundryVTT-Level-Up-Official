If the element you choose is not present at or near the target point, any damage dealt by this feature is halved, you have disadvantage on your spell attack, and creatures have advantage on any saving throws made to resist it.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>Water. </strong>You create a 20-foot tall, 20-foot wide wave that travels 30 feet in one direction and then crashes down. Any Large or smaller creatures and objects in the waveâ€™s path make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is carried with the wave. Any creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes no damage and is not moved.</p><p><br></p>",
