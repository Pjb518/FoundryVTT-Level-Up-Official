		"description": "<p>When you make a death saving throw, you can choose to set your own spirit loose. The spirit acts on your initiative, uses your statistics, carries ethereal copies of your equipment, and has full hit points and half your exertion pool. Your vengeful spirit is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. It can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but it takes 1d10 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.</p>\n<p>The vengeful spirit targets only the creature that reduced you to 0 hit points. Once that creature is defeated, the spirit returns to your body. While the vengeful spirit is active, you don&rsquo;t need to make death saving throws, but you still suffer failures if you are hit by an attack or take damage. You can&rsquo;t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
