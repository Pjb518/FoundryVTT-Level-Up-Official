You can hear through rushing wind, such as storms, as if they weren&rsquo;t there. In windy areas, you can choose to see and hear as if you were in two places at once, both where you are and at an additional point. The additional point can be at a spot in the direction the wind is coming from, a number of feet away equal to the wind&rsquo;s speed in miles per hour, potentially allowing you to see and hear around corners and other obstacles.</p>",
