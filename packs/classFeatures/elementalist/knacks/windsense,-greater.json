This allows you to see and hear at a distance of 1,000 feet from you, as long as there are no barriers blocking airflow. You are able to move your senses at a speed of 100 feet per round, and you create a flowing current of air at the point you are sensing that can be noticed, with a Perception DC equal to your spell save DC. You can only focus your senses on one point at a time, and you are unaware of your actual surroundings while using this ability.</p>",
