If you are already proficient, you instead gain an expertise die. Additionally, if you fail a Deception check made to tell a lie to a creature, you can instantly reroll, but you must take the second result even if it is worse, as you notice they aren&rsquo;t falling for your lies and quickly adapt. Once you use this ability on a creature, you cannot use it again on the same creature until you complete a long rest.</p>",
