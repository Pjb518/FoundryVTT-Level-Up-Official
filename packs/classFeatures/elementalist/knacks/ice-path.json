The ice path can go up or down at a maximum angle of 45 degrees; moving upwards costs double your movement, and you get a bonus to your speed downwards equal to the downward angle of the slope. Each 10 ft section of the path has AC 12 and 30 hit points, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. If a section of the path is destroyed, the path collapses. Ice created with this adaptation melts after 1 minute, unless the air temperature is below freezing.</p>",
