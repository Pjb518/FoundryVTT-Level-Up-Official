You suffer no penalties for attempting to use Intimidation on creatures that do not share a language with you, or who have no language, as the fear of fire transcends all language. Additionally, when you are under the effect of the Frightened condition, you make your attack rolls against the subject of your fear with advantage rather than disadvantage.</p>",
