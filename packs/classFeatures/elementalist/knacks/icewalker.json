You gain a Climb speed equal to your speed, but only on icy surfaces. You can move on top of water at half your speed, temporarily freezing the water below your feet; the ice washes away and melts after you pass. If the air temperature is below freezing, you can choose to create a path of ice behind you for others to follow, but the path must remain anchored to a surface, or else it melts in 1 minute.</p>",
