		"description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">As an action, you can create a passage through an element in which you have elemental affinity. You can create a 15-ft-wide, 15-foot-tall, 50-ft long tunnel through elemental material, following along with you as you move. The tunnel collapses and the elemental material returns to its previous state at the end of your turn if you do not use an action to maintain it each round. You can tunnel through storms, snow, soil and rock, wildfires, or even lava; the tunnel keeps all harmful effects from the material (such as heat, wind, or pressure) from affecting those inside while the tunnel is maintained.</p>",
