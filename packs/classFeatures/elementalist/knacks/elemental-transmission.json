		"description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">By spending 10 minutes focusing, you can use your element to communicate with another creature on the same plane as you. You must be able to name the creature, and both you and the creature must be within 10-ft of an amount of elemental material that you have affinity for, such as fog, a bowl of water, a roaring fire, or a pile of rocks. An image of you and the creature you are speaking to appears within the elemental material. If a creature is unwilling to communicate, they can still see and hear you, but they do not appear to you unless they choose to respond. While you are focused in this way, you are unaware of your real surroundings and only perceive the person you are speaking to.</p>",
