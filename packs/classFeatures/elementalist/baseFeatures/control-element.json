		"description": "<p>In addition to creating damaging blasts of elemental energy, elementalists are able to command and control elemental material at a distance. As an action, an elementalist can create effects at a range of 30 feet, manipulating ambient elemental material to create any of the following effects. You must possess the proper elemental affinity to control an element.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Elemental material weighing up to 5 lbs per elementalist level can be moved up to 30 feet.</li>\n<li>Elemental material up to a cubic foot can be reshaped (such as ice or stone), using your power in place of any required tool proficiencies. Shapes can be made in amorphous elements (like air, fire, or water), but the shapes only hold for as long as you spend an action.</li>\n<li>Air can be used to create light breezes, enough to ruffle and move material like paper and leaves, blow out tiny fires, or clear or create smells. You can also move air into a creature&rsquo;s lungs, allowing it to breathe for 1 minute in an environment it otherwise couldn&rsquo;t. You can use air to perform the Knockdown and Shove maneuvers against medium or smaller creatures within range.</li>\n<li>Earth can be used to shift stone and earth. A 5-ft square of soil can be dug, deposited 5 feet away. A 5- foot-square section of earth or stone can be made into difficult terrain, or a 5-foot-square section of earth or stone difficult terrain can be smoothed into normal terrain. Breaking rock can be attempted as an action using your spellcasting ability modifier with proficiency as if it were a Strength check, or you can deal damage to an inanimate earthen object as an action to deal your earth blast damage to it. Earth can be used to perform the Grapple, Knockdown, and Shove maneuvers against targets in contact with earth or stone, engulfing, shaking, or pushing them with the earth.</li>\n<li>Fire can be used to ignite flammable material. It can be used to expand a fire up to 5-feet, provided fuel is present. It can extinguish flames as large as a 5-foot cube, or a 5-foot cubic portion. You can create and hold a flame in your hand without burning yourself.</li>\n<li>Water can be used to stop or change the flow of water in a 5-foot-cube, though the currents aren&rsquo;t fast enough to hurt anything. You can cause a 5-ft square section of ground to grow slick or icy, requiring Acrobatics checks against your spell save DC to move through at regular speed. You can freeze a 5-ft square section of water as long as there are no creatures in it; the water unfreezes after an hour. You can also provide water for a water breathing creature so that it can breathe for 1 minute in an environment it otherwise couldn&rsquo;t. Water can be used to perform the Knockdown or Shove maneuvers against targets near water, or to Grapple or Knockdown targets standing on the ground by coating the floor with ice.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Indirect Elemental Blast</h2>\n<p>If there is a source of elemental material within your Control Elements range, you can use your control element ability and use it as a point of origin for your elemental blast. The target of your attack must be within range of the elemental material, and the origin must be a significant source of elemental material: still air is not sufficient, for instance, but wind is; a candle isn&rsquo;t, but a roaring campfire is; soil isn&rsquo;t, but rocks are.</p>\n<p>The elemental blast is resolved as normal, but the line of effect is drawn from the source of elemental material, redirecting wind, throwing a rock, causing a flame to leap, or launching a jet from a body of water. This may be used to bypass cover, or potentially launch surprise attacks. If the original elemental matter is small, such as a campfire or a bucket of water, it is snuffed out or used up by the attack. A solid object, like a rock, must be within your Command Elements weight limit, and the material takes damage equal to half your elemental blast when it hits its target.</p>",
