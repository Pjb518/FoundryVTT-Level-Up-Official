		"description": "<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-1c306f48-7fff-29c8-7add-b77ba405fa96\" dir=\"ltr\">At 13th level, you gain greater control of your elemental affinities. The range of your Control Elements ability increases to 60 feet. You can now perform the following effects as an action, or sustain an effect from the previous round as an action.</p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">You can move elemental material weighing up to 50 lbs per elementalist level. You can move multiple objects together, as long as they weigh less than your total limit together and fit within a 15 by 15 foot cube.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">You can target an elemental creature within range that is no larger than Huge size. The target makes a Strength save against your spell save DC or is moved up to 30 feet in any direction and is restrained (even in mid-air) until the end of your next turn. You cannot move a target beyond your 60 foot control range, or else it is released from your hold.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Fire can be used to move or expand fires. A 15 by 15 foot cube portion of fire, or a fire that fits within the area, can be moved up to 30 feet, or a fire can be expanded by a 15 by 15 foot portion. If there is no fuel present in the new area, the fire burns as long as you spend an action each round to maintain it. While you maintain it, the fire&rsquo;s damage increases to 1d6 times your Elemental Blast dice; otherwise it uses the fire&rsquo;s own damage dice. A 15 by 15 foot section of fire, or other hot material such as lava, can be cooled to ambient temperature, by moving the heat away from it, snuffing out fires and cooling portions of lava into stone.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
