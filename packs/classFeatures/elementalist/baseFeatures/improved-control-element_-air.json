The range of your Control Elements ability increases to 60 feet. You can now perform the following effects as an action, or sustain an effect from the previous round as an action.</p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">You can move elemental material weighing up to 50 lbs per elementalist level. You can move multiple objects together, as long as they weigh less than your total limit together and fit within a 15 by 15 foot cube.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">You can target an elemental creature within range that is no larger than Huge size. The target makes a Strength save against your spell save DC or is moved up to 30 feet in any direction and is restrained (even in mid-air) until the end of your next turn. You cannot move a target beyond your 60 foot control range, or else it is released from your hold.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Air can be used to push creatures of up to Huge size. Choose a creature within range. The target makes a Strength save against your spell DC or is moved up to 30 feet in any direction and is knocked prone. Swirling winds can be used to manipulate light objects weighing less than 5 lbs per elementalist level, moving them up to 30 feet, but this movement is not precise.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
