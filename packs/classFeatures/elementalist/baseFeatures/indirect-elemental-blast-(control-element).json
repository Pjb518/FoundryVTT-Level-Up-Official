The target of your attack must be within range of the elemental material, and the origin must be a significant source of elemental material: still air is not sufficient, for instance, but wind is; a candle isn&rsquo;t, but a roaring campfire is; soil isn&rsquo;t, but rocks are.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The elemental blast is resolved as normal, but the line of effect is drawn from the source of elemental material, redirecting wind, throwing a rock, causing a flame to leap, or launching a jet from a body of water. This may be used to bypass cover, or potentially launch surprise attacks. If the original elemental matter is small, such as a campfire or a bucket of water, it is snuffed out or used up by the attack. A solid object, like a rock, must be within your Command Elements weight limit, and the material takes damage equal to half your elemental blast when it hits its target.</p>",
