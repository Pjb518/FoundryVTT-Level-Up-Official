		"description": "<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-633a577b-7fff-451b-d259-b52727171e8b\" dir=\"ltr\">You wrap yourself in swiftly flowing wind to protect yourself against incoming attacks. You gain a +5 bonus to your speed.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, when you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to add your spellcasting ability bonus to your AC, potentially causing the attack to miss you. You can also use this same reaction in response to failing a saving throw against an inhaled effect, such as stinking cloud or an inhalation poison, gaining a +1d4 expertise die to the save.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At 10th level, you learn how to use your enveloping winds to redirect attacks. If a ranged weapon attack targeting you misses as a result of your enveloping winds reaction, you can choose another target within 60 feet of you and redirect the attack. You reroll the attack roll using your own Spell Attack modifier, using the damage of the original attack.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At 18th level, your enveloping winds become powerful enough to deflect even magic. You can now use your enveloping winds reaction to attempt to deflect any ranged attack, not just a ranged weapon attack.</p>",
