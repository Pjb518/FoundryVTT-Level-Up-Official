Your power is raw and unrefined, and takes care to shape it into true spells.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At 1st level, you only know how to cast two spells: your Elemental Blast and your Control Elements abilities. Though your Blast holds much of your offensive power, spells offer varied utility. See chapter 10 (page 490) of the A5E core rules for the general rules of spellcasting.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-8fa9da71-7fff-a753-28c4-512e47cf9644\">Spell Points</span></h3>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-3968f4fa-7fff-2026-d479-17a2b0d37a70\" dir=\"ltr\">The Elementalist table shows how many spell points you have. To cast one of your elementalist spells of 1st-level or higher, you must spend a number of spell points dependent on the spell&rsquo;s level, shown on the table below. You can also cast a spell you know at a higher spell level by spending the appropriate number of spell points. The maximum spell level you can cast is shown in the Spell Level column of the Elementalist table.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You regain all expended spell points when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<table style=\"width: 100%; height: 117.578px; border-width: 1px;\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 51.0067%;\"><col style=\"width: 48.9933%;\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 33.5938px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 33.5938px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Spell Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"height: 33.5938px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Spell Points</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px; text-align: center;\">7</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-6abcfc1f-7fff-4249-f437-986cd1de4b15\">Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher</span></h3>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-f6898577-7fff-e681-2983-766b837635e0\" dir=\"ltr\">At 2nd level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice drawn from the elementalist spell list. Furthermore, you must have the spell&rsquo;s elemental affinity to learn it as well; the elementalist spell list is divided by level and element. Regardless of the spell&rsquo;s descriptions, an elementalist&rsquo;s spells utilize their elements to create their effects. For instance, an earth elementalist&rsquo;s black tentacles spell may appear as an earthen hand or thick grasping vines.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Spells Known column of the Elementalist table shows when you learn more elementalist spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level you are able to cast, and of an element in which you possess elemental affinity. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st- or 2nd-level.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the elementalist spells you know and replace it with another spell from the elementalist spell list, which also must be of a level and element of which you can cast.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-3c5938ef-7fff-1b37-3562-73799e1bda44\">Spellcasting Ability</span></h3>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-5025200b-7fff-6ed0-c496-de1f9ab3c57b\" dir=\"ltr\">Your elemental power is wild and untamed, and it expresses itself differently in each elementalist. As such, the method that you understand and shape this power is individual to you. It may come through study and rigorous practice, insight and awareness of yourself, or pure will power.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Choose Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma to be your spellcasting ability. Once you make this choice, you cannot change it. You use the chosen ability whenever a spell or ability refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use that ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an elementalist spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-8144fef0-7fff-18dc-53ba-4a234a334fae\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +&nbsp;your chosen ability modifier</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your chosen ability modifier</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-2c70cc4a-7fff-caf8-3d06-ea2e81d214d5\">Spellcasting Focus</span></h3>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-61c7455b-7fff-eaf0-745c-8bd51c7ea066\">You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your elementalist spells.</span></p>",
