		"description": "<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-b68706a5-7fff-e4c2-5b6b-7857dc5b77d5\" dir=\"ltr\">In addition to creating damaging blasts of elemental energy, elementalists are able to command and control elemental material at a distance. As an action, an elementalist can create effects at a range of 30 feet, manipulating ambient elemental material to create any of the following effects. You must possess the proper elemental affinity to control an element.</p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Elemental material weighing up to 5 lbs per elementalist level can be moved up to 30 feet.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Elemental material up to a cubic foot can be reshaped (such as ice or stone), using your power in place of any required tool proficiencies. Shapes can be made in amorphous elements (like air, fire, or water), but the shapes only hold for as long as you spend an action.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Earth can be used to shift stone and earth. A 5-ft square of soil can be dug, deposited 5 feet away. A 5-foot-square section of earth or stone can be made into difficult terrain, or a 5-foot-square section of earth or stone difficult terrain can be smoothed into normal terrain. Breaking rock can be attempted as an action using your spellcasting ability modifier with proficiency as if it were a Strength check, or you can deal damage to an inanimate earthen object as an action to deal your earth blast damage to it. Earth can be used to perform the Grapple, Knockdown, and Shove maneuvers against targets in contact with earth or stone, engulfing, shaking, or pushing them with the earth.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
