You can now perform the following effects as an action, or sustain an effect from the previous round as an action.</p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">You can move elemental material weighing up to 50 lbs per elementalist level. You can move multiple objects together, as long as they weigh less than your total limit together and fit within a 15 by 15 foot cube.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">You can target an elemental creature within range that is no larger than Huge size. The target makes a Strength save against your spell save DC or is moved up to 30 feet in any direction and is restrained (even in mid-air) until the end of your next turn. You cannot move a target beyond your 60 foot control range, or else it is released from your hold.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Water can be used to make 15 by 15 ft sections of ground slick. Creatures that attempt to move at full speed through the area must make a Dexterity save against your spell save DC or fall prone. Water can also be used to make waves to push a target creature of up to Huge size within range of you and the source of water. The target makes a Strength save against your spell DC or is moved up to 30 feet in any direction away from the water</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
