		"description": "<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-b68706a5-7fff-e4c2-5b6b-7857dc5b77d5\" dir=\"ltr\">In addition to creating damaging blasts of elemental energy, elementalists are able to command and control elemental material at a distance. As an action, an elementalist can create effects at a range of 30 feet, manipulating ambient elemental material to create any of the following effects. You must possess the proper elemental affinity to control an element.</p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Elemental material weighing up to 5 lbs per elementalist level can be moved up to 30 feet.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Elemental material up to a cubic foot can be reshaped (such as ice or stone), using your power in place of any required tool proficiencies. Shapes can be made in amorphous elements (like air, fire, or water), but the shapes only hold for as long as you spend an action.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Water can be used to stop or change the flow of water in a 5-foot-cube, though the currents aren&rsquo;t fast enough to hurt anything. You can cause a 5-ft square section of ground to grow slick or icy, requiring Acrobatics checks against your spell save DC to move through at regular speed. You can freeze a 5-ft square section of water as long as there are no creatures in it; the water unfreezes after an hour. You can also provide water for a water breathing creature so that it can breathe for 1 minute in an environment it otherwise couldn&rsquo;t. Water can be used to perform the Knockdown or Shove maneuvers against targets near water, or to Grapple or Knockdown targets standing on the ground by coating the floor with ice.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
