It gains another +1 hp per level, and its Hit Dice increase to d10&rsquo;s. Additionally, as an action while it is large sized, you are able to use your action to command your elemental companion to use its Elder ability, shown below.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Air, Whirlwind:</strong> Your elemental companion takes the form of a whirlwind, flies up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks, and then resumes its normal form. When a creature shares its space with the whirlwind for the first time during its turn, that creature must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature is carried inside the elemental&rsquo;s space until the whirlwind ends, taking your air blast damage, and falls prone at the end of the movement. The whirlwind can carry one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures.</p>",
