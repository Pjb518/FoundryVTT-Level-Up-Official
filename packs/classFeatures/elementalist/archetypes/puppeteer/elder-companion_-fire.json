It gains another +1 hp per level, and its Hit Dice increase to d10&rsquo;s. Additionally, as an action while it is large sized, you are able to use your action to command your elemental companion to use its Elder ability, shown below.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Fire, Wildfire:</strong> Your elemental companion moves up to half its Speed without provoking opportunity attacks. It can enter the spaces of hostile creatures, but not end its movement there. When a creature shares its space with the elemental for the first time during this movement, the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, it takes your fire blast damage, or half damage on a success.</p>",
