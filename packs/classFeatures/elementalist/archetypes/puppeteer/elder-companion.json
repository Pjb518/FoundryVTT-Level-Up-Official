		"description": "<p>As you grow in power, so does your elemental companion.</p>\n<p>At 11th level, your elemental companion grows to large size, though you can reduce it to medium or small or back again to large as an action. It gains another +1 hp per level, and its Hit Dice increase to d10&rsquo;s. Additionally, as an action while it is large sized, you are able to use your action to command your elemental companion to use its Elder ability, shown below.</p>\n<p><strong>Air, Whirlwind: </strong>Your elemental companion takes the form of a whirlwind, flies up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks, and then resumes its normal form. When a creature shares its space with the whirlwind for the first time during its turn, that creature must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature is carried inside the elemental&rsquo;s space until the whirlwind ends, taking your air blast damage, and falls prone at the end of the movement. The whirlwind can carry one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Earth, Earth&rsquo;s Embrace: </strong>Your elemental companion makes a melee attack against one Large or smaller creature within 5 ft. of it. It uses your spell attack bonus and deals damage equal to your earth blast. If the attack hits, the target is grappled (escape DC is equal to your spell save DC). Until this grapple ends, the elemental can&rsquo;t burrow, but its slam attacks are made with advantage against the grappled target. The elemental can move at full speed while carrying grappled creatures. It can grapple one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Fire, Wildfire: </strong>Your elemental companion moves up to half its Speed without provoking opportunity attacks. It can enter the spaces of hostile creatures, but not end its movement there. When a creature shares its space with the elemental for the first time during this movement, the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, it takes your fire blast damage, or half damage on a success.</p>\n<p><strong>Water, Whelm: </strong>Your elemental companion targets each Large or smaller creature in its space. Each target makes a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the targets take your water blast damage and are grappled (escape DC equal to your spell save DC); a creature can attempt to escape with an Athletics check instead of a Strength or Dexterity saving throw if it chooses, swimming free. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and unable to breathe air. The elemental can move at full speed while carrying grappled creatures inside its space. It can grapple one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures.</p>",
