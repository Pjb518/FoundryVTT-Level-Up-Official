It gains another +1 hp per level, and its Hit Dice increase to d10&rsquo;s. Additionally, as an action while it is large sized, you are able to use your action to command your elemental companion to use its Elder ability, shown below.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Water, Whelm:</strong> Your elemental companion targets each Large or smaller creature in its space. Each target makes a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the targets take your water blast damage and are grappled (escape DC equal to your spell save DC); a creature can attempt to escape with an Athletics check instead of a Strength or Dexterity saving throw if it chooses, swimming free. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and unable to breathe air. The elemental can move at full speed while carrying grappled creatures inside its space. It can grapple one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures.</p>",
