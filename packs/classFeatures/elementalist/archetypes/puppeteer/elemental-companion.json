It is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the Elemental Companion stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You determine the creature&rsquo;s exact appearance, which has no effect on its game statistics, but the creature is made of pure elemental material: windy clouds for air, flames for fire, soil and rock for earth, and roiling water for water. Your elemental companion&rsquo;s element is determined by your elemental affinity. This determines a number of its abilities and features. If you possess multiple elemental affinities, you choose one of them when your elemental companion manifests; you may switch if you summon a new one.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In combat, your elemental companion shares your initiative count. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dash, Dodge, or Sprint action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action, not just those listed (such as basic combat maneuvers like Push or Grapple).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you cast a spell or use elemental blast, you can have your elemental companion be that spell&rsquo;s origin, as long as you can see your elemental companion and it is within 60 feet. Additionally, as an action, you can spend spell points to heal your elemental companion if you can see it and it is within 60 feet of you; it regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 per spell point you spend, up to your spell point casting limit. Your elemental companion has its own Hit Dice, which it can use to heal during short rests. If your elemental companion has died, you can revive it by focusing your power during a short or a long rest. Rather than reviving a companion, you can alternatively summon a new one.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Your elemental companion also dies if you die. When it dies, it crumbles and evaporates, fading into nothing and leaving behind any items it was wielding, wearing, or carrying. If you are unconscious, your elemental companion acts on its own to defend you, using its full range of actions, remaining by your side.</p>",
