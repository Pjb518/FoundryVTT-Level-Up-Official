It gains another +1 hp per level, and its Hit Dice increase to d10&rsquo;s. Additionally, as an action while it is large sized, you are able to use your action to command your elemental companion to use its Elder ability, shown below.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Earth, Earth&rsquo;s Embrace:</strong> Your elemental companion makes a melee attack against one creature Large or smaller creature within 5 ft. of it. It uses your spell attack bonus and deals damage equal to your earth blast. If the attack hits, the target is grappled (escape DC is equal to your spell save DC). Until this grapple ends, the elemental can&rsquo;t burrow, but its slam attacks are made with advantage against the grappled target. The elemental can move at full speed while carrying grappled creatures. It can grapple one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures.</p>",
