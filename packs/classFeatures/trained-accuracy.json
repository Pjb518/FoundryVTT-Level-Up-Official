		"description": "<p>At 2nd level, you learn to maintain a level of discipline that spills over into everything you do. This perpetual state of focus allows you to perform incredible feats. When using Trained Accuracy, the bonus to attack rolls from Fighting Style: Archery becomes a +2 bonus to damage on ranged weapon attacks.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> An adventurer that has Fighting Style: Archery gains no bonus to attack rolls from the fighting style when using Trained Accuracy, and instead gains a +2 bonus to damage on ranged weapon attacks.</p></blockquote><h3 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>ACCURACY BONUS</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: start\">When you make a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to gain an attack bonus or damage bonus as shown on the Accuracy Bonus table. Between long rests, you have a number of uses equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).</p><p>+1 hit or +1d6 (1 use) </p><p>+2 hit or +3d6 damage (2 uses) </p><p>+3 hit or +5d6 damage (3 uses)</p><h3 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>ACCURACY RESERVE</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: start\">If you have not moved since the beginning of your last turn, you gain a +1 bonus to weapon attack rolls until the end of your turn. You lose this bonus if you move.</p>",
