    "description": "<p>Beginning at 3rd level, you gain the ability to learn magic rituals and cast them. You acquire a spellbook. When you find a spell with the ritual tag, you can transcribe it into your spellbook if the spell’s level is equal to or less than the highest-level herald spell you can cast. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gold for the rare inks needed to inscribe it. Once a spell is transcribed in this manner, you can cast it as a herald spell.</p>",
