While they are under this effect, you may use your action to issue simple commands (no more than a sentence or two) which they are compelled to obey. They will not take any action that is obviously harmful to them, and so will not leap from a great height, jump onto a sword, or purposefully self-inflict any damage. They follow the command until you issue a new one.</p>",
