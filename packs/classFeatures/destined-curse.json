    "description": "<p>You can use a bonus action to place a curse on a creature you can see within 30 feet. The curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target dies, you die, or you become incapacitated. The curse has the following effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you deal damage against the cursed creature, it takes an additional 1d4 force damage. This extra damage increases by 1d4 at 10th level, and again at 15th and 20th level.</li>\n<li class=\"Indent1\">You gain a pool of destiny dice, which begins empty. Each destiny die represents a small adjustment you can make to the web of fate. Whenever the cursed creature rolls with&nbsp;<span class=\"freelinking-link\">advantage</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<span class=\"freelinking-link\">disadvantage</span>&nbsp;, add one destiny die to this pool. When a creature other than you that you can see rolls a d20, you can spend a destiny die (no action required) to add 1d4 to the roll or subtract 1d4 from it. The pool disappears when you finish a&nbsp;<span class=\"freelinking-link\">short or long rest</span>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you have used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
