At the start of each of your turns while you are bloodied, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier. You don’t gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points. </p><p>In addition, while you are using Armaments of Nature the amount of hit points you regain doubles, you regain hit points even when you are not bloodied, and weapons formed using Armaments of Nature gain a +3 magical bonus to attack and damage.</p>",
