		"description": "<p>You have developed a small number of clever gambits, deft maneuvers, and canny guards which help you prevail in battle by using your wits. The number of tricks you know is listed on the Savant table, and you can choose from the list below and from the list of tricks your archetype makes available.</p><p>To use a trick, you must first prepare it by spending a bonus action. You cannot prepare a trick outside of an encounter, but once a trick is prepared, it remains prepared until you use it, until the encounter ends, or until you spend a bonus action to replace it with a different trick. You can only have one trick prepared at time.</p><p>Different tricks can be used at different times. Some require your action, bonus action, or reaction. Others might be used when making attacks.</p><p>Some of your tricks require your target to make a saving throw to resist its effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Trick save DC </strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose to replace a trick you know with a different trick.</p><p></p><h3><strong>TYPES OF TRICKS</strong></h3><p>Some tricks are called <strong>Aegises</strong>, which let you use your reaction to defend against some sort of attack. Other tricks are called <strong>Flourishes</strong>, which you can use when you hit with a melee weapon attack .</p><p>If a trick offers a saving throw , after you use it against a particular creature, that creature has advantage on saving throws against other uses of that same trick until the end of combat. If the trick doesn’t permit a saving throw, after you use it against a particular creature, you cannot use the same trick against that creature for the rest of the combat.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h3><strong>AEGISES</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Attention Diverting Aegis</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Canny Dodge Aegis</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Committee Defense Aegis</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Mindful Reason Aegis</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Serpentine Rush Aegis</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Tangled Dance Aegis</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Undermining Taunt Aegis</strong></p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"></li></ul><h3><strong>FLOURISHES</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Antagonizing Flourish</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Disarming Flourish</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Experimental Flourish</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Guiding Flourish</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Menacing Flourish</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Surgical Flourish</strong></p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"></li></ul><h3><strong>OTHER TRICKS</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Assess Vulnerability</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Direct Ally</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Frightful Suppression</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Rallying Word</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Saving Advice</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Sweeping Stride</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Timely Tool</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Unbalancing Intervention</strong></p></li></ul>",
