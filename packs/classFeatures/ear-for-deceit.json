When listening to a creature speak, provided you share at least one language, you are immediately aware if it is being dishonest though you have no special ability to obtain the truth without using your Channel Divinity. Creatures protected from divination, such as by the <em>nondetection</em> spell, are immune to this feature.</p>",
