You can use a bonus action to become partially incorporeal, like a shadow, for 1 minute.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While in this form you receive the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">You gain immunity to the following conditions: grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, and restrained.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">You gain resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage from non-magical attacks, and immunity to necrotic damage.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">You can pass through occupied spaces, and squeeze through gaps as small as 1 inch wide. If you end your turn in the space of another creature (or after one minute you are still squeezing through a gap too small for your regular form), you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space, taking 1d10 damage.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">All other creatures within 10ft of you cannot regain hit points, rage hit points, or temporary hit points via any means.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">While in dim light or darkness, attacks against you have disadvantage.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
