		"description": "<p class=\"preFade fadeIn\">At 2nd level you gain the power to create a permanent undead minion for yourself. The minion follows your orders. If it is destroyed, or if you choose to dismiss it (which permanently destroys the minion) you may create a new minion once you have taken a long rest. You may only have one minion at a time, and minions created in this way cannot create or summon other creatures themselves.</p>\n<p>To create a minion you must spend one hour performing an unholy ritual. At the end of the hour, your minion arrives.</p>\n<p>Your minion may be any non-elite undead creature with a Challenge Rating lower than half your wizard level (round down). For example, at 3rd level, you can create a CR 1 minion such as a&nbsp;<strong>ghoul</strong>, and at 7th level you may create a CR 3 minion, such as a&nbsp;<strong>mummy</strong>.</p>",
