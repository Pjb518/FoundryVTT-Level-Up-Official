    "description": "<p>At 17th level, you are able to manipulate the burning brilliance of the stars themselves. Choose an object or creature within 60 feet. For 1 minute the target emits bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. When a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the target or first enters into a space within 30 feet of the target on its turn, it makes a Constitution saving throw or becomes blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br></p><p>The first time this feature is used per long rest, any creature within 30 feet of the target takes 12d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half damage on a success. Magical auras within the lightâ€™s radius become visible for 1 hour, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius for 1 hour. An invisible creature that fails its saving throw against the radiant damage is also revealed and it sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius for 1 hour. </p>",
