During this time all of the creature&rsquo;s movement speeds are reduced to 0 and the creature may not willingly move. The target creature gains the ability to Trip as a reaction when another creature enters or tries to leave its threatened area, but it must use its reaction to trip the first creature that triggers this effect.</p>",
