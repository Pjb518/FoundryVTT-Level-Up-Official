Less a thing or substance itself, you&rsquo;ve uncovered the secrets of being, and how to transform the fundamental forms into another. Whenever you finish a long rest you can create one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>50 gp worth of liquid gold or other valuable metals, gemstone crystals, or any item needed as a spell component.</li>\n<li>A @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-adventuring-gear.Item.wD306JjC4kmYYias]{Potion of Longevity}, which when drunk alleviates the effects of old age, restoring the drinker to a young adult form (assuming they are older than a young adult). This effect fades and the effects of old age after 1 week unless the drinker consumes another potion of longevity.</li>\n<li>A @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-adventuring-gear.Item.X6xN1F1S1rcmJfqq]{Potion of Health}, which when drunk cures the poisoned condition, all diseases, and restores 6d10 hit points.</li>\n<li>A @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-adventuring-gear.Item.vSa20Hw4dW2iD1zG]{Solution of Dissolution}, which can dissolve up to 5 cubic feet of any non-magical material (except for adamantine). Creatures that drink this solution take 12d10 acid damage.</li>\n</ul>",
