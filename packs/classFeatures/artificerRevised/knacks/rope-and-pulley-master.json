		"description": "<p>Numerous logistic puzzles can be solved with just a rope, a pulley, and proper application of intellect. By spending 10 minutes working with at least 300 feet of rope, you can create the following through ingenious use of ropes and pulleys.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A rope system that provides safe travel over a gap of 50 feet or less. You must be able to access both sides of this gap to create a rope system in this way.</li>\n<li>\n<p>A rope system that allows a creature to lift an object of a weight up to 5 &times; its carrying capacity directly up as far as 50 feet.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A rope system that allows a creature to drag an object of a weight up to 5 &times; its carrying capacity as far as 50 feet.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A manual rope elevator that allows a single Medium-sized or smaller creature to travel up to 50 feet straight up and down as if it were difficult terrain (a tree,<br>cliff wall, ceiling, or similar structure is required at the top of this elevator for the ropes to attach).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also deconstruct and recover the rope used in any of these rope creations by spending 10 minutes tearing it down.</p>",
