Whenever you begin a long rest that would incur the penalties of roughing it (such as resting without heat in a cold environment, on unlevel rocky terrain, or without protection from pests in swampy environments) you may repurpose one of your currently prepared spell inventions. If you do, you do not suffer the penalties of roughing it during that long rest. You can determine the exact nature of this repurposed spell invention (some examples include using a @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.fdkaoynn8g8aqxdr]{Burning Hands} spell invention as a space heater or a @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.ks87w0iees5tbu0z]{Shocking Grasp} spell invention as a bug zapper).</p>",
