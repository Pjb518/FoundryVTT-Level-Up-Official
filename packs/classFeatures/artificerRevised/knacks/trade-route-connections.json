You gain an expertise die on all Charisma checks made to interact with merchants or tradesmen. In addition, you know the trade routes of any nation you are familiar with, what roads are most traveled, and which roads are most often accosted by banditry. At your narrator&rsquo;s discretion, you may be able to leverage these connections into joining merchant caravans or even being hired on as guards for them.</p>",
