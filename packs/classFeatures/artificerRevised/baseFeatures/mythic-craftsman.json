		"description": "<p>At 20th level, you have reached the pinnacle of artifice, a master of craft responsible for mythical artifacts and wonders beyond comprehension. Whenever you infuse an item, you can imbue that item with 2 lesser artifact benefits of your choice or a single greater artifact benefit of your choice (see Chapter 8: Enchanted Gear in Trials &amp; Treasures). You can choose to imbue items with 2 additional lesser artifact benefits or 1 additional greater artifact benefit of your choice by spending an additional infusion use. You can have a maximum of one item infused in this way at a time, and any items you&rsquo;ve infused with artifact benefits lose them when you infuse another item with artifact benefits.</p>\n<p>In addition, whenever you craft a magic item from a schematic with a rarity of very rare or higher, you can add up to 2 lesser artifact benefits or 1 greater artifact benefit to the effects of that magic item.</p>\n<p>In any case where the narrator would make a selection for benefits granted by this feature, you may make those selections instead.</p>",
