At the end of another creature's turn, you can use your reaction to activate a battle hymn. This battle hymn replaces any currently activated battle hymns. Replacing an activated battle hymn does not require expending a use of Bardic Inspiration if it has no target yet. </p><p>In addition, choose one of the following. </p><p>· Your battle hymns no longer require concentration. </p><p>· Your battle hymns can affect a number of additional creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). </p><p>· You learn an additional battle hymn that does not count against the number of battle hymns you can know. When choosing this battle hymn, you are treated as having 4 more bard levels for the purpose of meeting its prerequisites. If you change this Battle Hymn Focus, you forget the additional battle hymn. </p><p>Whenever you gain a bard level, you may change your Battle Hymn Focus.</p>",
