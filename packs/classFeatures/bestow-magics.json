		"description": "<p>At 13th level, your understanding of magic is so thorough that you can even grant it to others. You can spend 1 minute touching a willing creature and concentrating, spending a spell slot of 3rd-level or lower. When you do, choose a spell you have prepared of that level or lower. The creature can cast the spell using the slot you expended, following its normal rules for casting time, spell components, range, and concentration, but using your spellcasting ability modifier, spell attack modifier, and spell save DC. You can only have one spell imbued at a time, and if you bestow a spell upon a different creature the previous spell dissipates, its magic unspent and the spell slot used to imbue it expended.</p>",
