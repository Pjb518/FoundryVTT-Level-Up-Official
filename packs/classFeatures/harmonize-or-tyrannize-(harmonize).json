Choose one of the following:&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>HARMONIZE</strong></h3><p>During a short rest you may choose to meditate and harmonize with your surroundings. If you do, at the end of your rest you attune to the area in a 5-mile radius around you. You magically know what types of creatures are present in your attuned area, their approximate numbers, and if there are any magics disturbing the natural order in your attuned area. While in your attuned area, you have advantage on Nature, Perception, and Survival checks, and&nbsp;blindsight out to a range of 30 feet. Once attuned to an area, you remain attuned for the next 24 hours. You can only attune to one area at a time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",
