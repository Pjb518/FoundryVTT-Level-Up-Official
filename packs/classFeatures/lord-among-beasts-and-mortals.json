		"description": "<p>As the mighty dragon guards its lair, so too do you establish your home wherever you roam. Starting at 6th level, when you start a short or long rest in an area that is not within 1 mile of an established settlement, you can spend 10 minutes in communion with the land to protect your camp until you finish your rest. Beasts who approach within 100 feet of your camp become docile and placid, refusing to attack you or your companions. Additionally, friendly creatures in your camp gain advantage on Perception checks to spot danger, and on Intimidation checks against intruders.</p><p>If you repeat this effect every day in the same location for a year, the range of the aura increases to 500 feet and the effect becomes permanent. When you have a permanent lair, your Prestige increases by an amount equal to half your proficiency bonus. You can only have one location prepared in this way at a time, and it fades if you are ever away from your lair for a year or longer. If you die, the effect fades after 2d10 days.</p>",
