		"description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Your strength of will is respected in many trades. You may spend eight hours working with others at a trade where hard work and strength of personality are respected, such as logging, mining, or wrangling, to gain the ability to call on the other workers for one favor. The favor must be within your colleagues&rsquo; ability to perform, and they will not work against their own self-interest. Example favors include rallying a group to back you up when confronting a powerful individual, helping to construct (or deconstruct) a structure, spreading the news of your heroism around the community, or providing you with a critical piece of information about local affairs.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you do not call in this favor within a month, the goodwill dissipates. If you work for a week, the favor can be called in within six months; if you work for a month, the favor can be called in any time in the next year.</p>",
