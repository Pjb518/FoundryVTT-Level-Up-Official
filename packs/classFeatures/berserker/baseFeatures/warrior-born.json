Choose one of the following.</p>\n<h2>Agitate</h2>\n<p>Many battles have taught you how to spot aggressive body language like a pursed eyebrow, tensed temple, or protruding vein, and you&rsquo;ve mastered using these cues to unsettle others outside of combat. Make an Intimidation check opposed by the Insight check of a creature you can see and hear within 20 feet. On a success, you subtly press the creature to act out. What exactly the creature does&mdash;back away quickly, blurt out something compromising, draw a weapon, look towards a concealed or disguised companion, protectively touch something it is carrying&mdash;is at the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion.</p>\n<p>Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2>Fearsome Reputation</h2>\n<p>Word spreads of your prodigious strength or how terrifying you can be in battle. Whenever you are in a settlement, at least one commoner approaches you with a modest gift or bribe and beseeches you to help settle a feud, move a large obstacle, or otherwise make use of your impressive might. In addition to their offering, they are eager to tell you about their home and neighbors.</p>\n<h2>Imposing Prowess</h2>\n<p>When an ally you can see and hear makes a Deception or Persuasion check, you can use your reaction to support them with an intimidating display of strength or unsettling glower. Your ally rerolls the check, gaining an expertise die on the roll.</p>\n<p>Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
