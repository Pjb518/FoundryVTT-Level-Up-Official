Choose one of the following.</p>\n<h2>Provoking Attitude</h2>\n<p>You know how to piss people off. You can expend one use of @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.htgvror5v9twusgs]{Rage}and choose a creature within 60 feet that can hear or see you. The creature makes a Charisma saving throw against your Furious Critical DC. On a failure, it makes or accepts a challenge. The nature of this challenge is at the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion but is usually a duel or opposed check: archery with Dexterity, arm-wrestling with Strength, competing with a gaming set, distance running with Constitution, wrestling with Athletics, and so on.</p>\n<h2>Roaring Pause</h2>\n<p>When initiative is rolled you can expend one use of Rage to make an Intimidation check (DC 8 + number of creatures that rolled initiative) to briefly unveil the boundless fury within in a furious roar. On a success each creature stops what it is doing and can only make statements and a Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion check on its turn. On a success by 5 or more initiative is rerolled, and you choose a number of creatures equal to your Constitution modifier to gain advantage on their initiative roll.</p>\n<h2>Takes One To Know One</h2>\n<p>You know another warrior when you see one. When you see a creature, you know if it is proficient with more than simple weapons or has access to combat maneuvers.</p>",
