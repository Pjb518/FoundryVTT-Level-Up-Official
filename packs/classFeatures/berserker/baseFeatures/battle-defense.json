In addition, your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor, you can still benefit from raging while wearing heavy armor, and you do not count the weight of any worn armor when determining your carrying capacity.</p>\n<h2>Rugged Defense</h2>\n<p>While you are not wearing any armor, your armor class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>\n<p>In addition, your speed increases by 5 feet while you aren&rsquo;t wearing heavy armor.
