Choose one of the following.</p>\n<h2>Armed Assistance</h2>\n<p>Mercenary groups make a point of making your acquaintance, especially in larger towns. As part of their hospitality they feed you and your companions, and provide a safe place to sleep, as well as offer to trade information and word of any jobs your group may be interested in. When these meetings go particularly well they might offer more tangible help in the form of scouting the area around a monster&rsquo;s den or distracting a group of bandits to give you an edge.</p>\n<h2>Noble Curiosity</h2>\n<p>Your reputation and ferocity have sparked the fascination of the nobility. A liveried servant is likely to approach you when you enter the holdings of such a noble and invite you to take part in their employer&rsquo;s hospitality. This includes lavish feasting, introductions to the rich and powerful, and offers of assistance such as mounts, the repair of your armor and weapons, and miscellaneous items worth less than 5 gold.</p>\n<h2>Token of Gratitude</h2>\n<p>Word of your deeds is not just advantageous to you: many merchants are eager to capitalize on having done business with someone of your reputation. Upon recognizing you, they offer up to 15% off of the listed price of a particular item in exchange for some sign of your presence such as a small token or autograph.</p>",
