While you are raging, a creature with a regeneration ability that starts its turn within 10 feet of you regains only half as many hit points as normal (rounded down).</p><p>You also gain the supernatural ability to devour life force from downed foes. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, you recover one expended hit die. For you to do so, the creature&rsquo;s CR must be at least half your character level (rounded down).</p>",
