Your spellcasting ability is Charisma and you can select spells from the chaos, prismatic, unarmed, and weaponry schools.</p>\n<p>Unlike most berserkers, you can cast spells while raging, but you cannot concentrate on them, and casting a spell while raging inflicts a point of psychic damage per level of the spell slot used which cannot be reduced or negated by any means. Cantrips are considered first-level spells for the purpose of calculating this psychic damage.</p>",
