When you use this Furious Critical option, roll a [[/r d12]] and consult the following table:</p>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>D12 Roll</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Result</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>The attack deals an additional [[/r 2d6]] points of fire damage and the target catches fire, taking [[/r 1d6]] ongoing fire damage until an action is spent to douse the flames.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>The attack deals an additional [[/r 2d6]] points of thunder damage and the target is deafened until the end of its next turn.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Flowering plants sprout from the wound. The target takes [[/r 1d8]] necrotic and [[/r 1d8]] psychic damage from the sprouting and horror respectively and is rattled until an action is spent to rip the plant out, dealing an additional [[/r 1d10]] points of necrotic damage.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>The attack deals an additional [[/r 2d6]] cold damage and the target&rsquo;s move speeds are reduced by 10 until the end of its next turn.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>The target takes no additional damage from the attack, but is flung 30 feet directly up, after which it falls normally. Creatures with a fly speed can make a Dexterity save against your move DC to &ldquo;catch&rdquo; themselves in the air, avoiding falling on a success.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>The target is turned into an indestructible, immovable rock of the same size category as its normal creature size until the end of its next turn, after which point it returns to normal. This effect ends any shape-changing effects on the creature as part of its process.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>The target takes [[/r 2d6]] points of necrotic damage and you are healed for an equal amount.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>The target takes [[/r2d6]] points of radiant damage and is outlined by a faerie fire effect until the end of its next turn.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>The target is doused with frigid water that appears from nowhere. It takes [[/r 1d10]] points of cold damage, immediately ends any ongoing fire or acid damage it is taking, and for the next minute, it has disadvantage on saves against effects that would inflict cold or lightning damage on it.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>The target takes [[/r 2d6]] points of acid damage and its armor (if it is wearing any) has its AC decreased by 1 until it can be repaired. If this reduces armor&rsquo;s AC to 0, it breaks.&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>The target takes [[/r 2d6]] points of force damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>The target takes no damage and the attack&rsquo;s damage is instead reflected back on you.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
