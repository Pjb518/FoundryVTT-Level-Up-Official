You must be proficient in a skill in order to gain an expertise die from Overpowering Personality.</p><h3><strong>Roguish Charm</strong></h3><p>You gain an expertise die on Persuasion checks. After you spend a minute in conversation with a creature that is not hostile, you may make a Persuasion check opposed by its Insight. On a success, the creature is nonmagically charmed by you for 1 hour. The charm ends early if you or your allies harm the creature. Once you’ve used this feature successfully, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
