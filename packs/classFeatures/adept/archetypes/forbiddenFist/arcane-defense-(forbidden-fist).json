While this ability is active, a creature that hits you with a melee attack must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature that fails the save takes force damage equal to your martial arts die.</p><p>If you have the Agile Defense ability, you instead may instead use Flurry of Blows, Long Step, or Patient Defense after casting a spell with a casting time of one action.</p>",
