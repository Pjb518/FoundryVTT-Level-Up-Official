Choose three of the following benefits:</p>\n<p><strong>Boon of Death.</strong> The favor of gods of death falls upon you whenever you take a life. When you reduce a living creature to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to spend 2 exertion and gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your martial arts die plus your proficiency bonus. In addition, you have advantage on death saving throws for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Boon of Hunting.</strong> When you succeed on a Survival check to Hunt and Gather, you find yourself under the favor of hunting gods and gather twice as much Supply.</p>\n<p><strong>Boon of Love.</strong> When you succeed on a Persuasion check against a creature indifferent to you, gods of love show you favor. You can spend 3 exertion to make an indifferent creature friendly towards you for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong>Boon of Speed.</strong> When you move more than your Speed during your turn, you find yourself under the favor of speed gods and can use your reaction to spend 2 exertion and take the Dodge action.</p>\n<p><strong>Boon of Tactics.</strong> When you make an opportunity attack against a creature, gods of battle show you favor. You can spend 2 exertion to gain advantage on the opportunity attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Boon of War.</strong> When you score a critical hit against a creature, you find yourself under the favor of war gods and can use your reaction to spend 2 exertion and acquire this boon.
