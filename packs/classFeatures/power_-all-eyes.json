As a bonus action, you can spend 1 sorcery point to put out a subtle pulse that causes all creatures within 60&nbsp;feet to take notice of you, allowing you to speak and be heard even in the midst of chaos. During combat, this notice lasts only a split second—not long enough to distract, but allowing you to make a Charisma check as part of the bonus action used to activate this feature.</p>",
