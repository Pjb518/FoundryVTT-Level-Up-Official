		"description": "<p>Starting at 14th level, you’ve learned just the right words to get people to cast off their shackles and rebel. As an action, you may choose a hostile creature that is operating under the command of another creature that is hostile to you. So long as the target is able to hear you, of a Challenge Rating 5 below your level, and can understand a language that you speak, it makes a Charisma saving throw against your clever tricks save DC. On a failed save the target is convinced to change sides and becomes an ally to you and your other allies, even becoming hostile to its former allies. The chosen creature is not under your control and may change its attitudes later depending on your actions or the actions of your allies. This is not a charm effect. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until after you finish a long rest.</p>",
