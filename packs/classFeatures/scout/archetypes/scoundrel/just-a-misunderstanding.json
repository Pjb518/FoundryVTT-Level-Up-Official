Whenever you add a @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.b5B9FWPQ77ULdvBa]{Dastardly Gambit} die to a Charisma check made to influence a hostile creature, that creatureâ€™s attitude to you is treated as if it were indifferent even if you or your allies were previously or are currently fighting it. Any past attacks or aggressive actions are woven into your strangely credible version of events that eases over blame, but this does not forgive future attacks or aggressive actions taken after you use this feature.</p>",
