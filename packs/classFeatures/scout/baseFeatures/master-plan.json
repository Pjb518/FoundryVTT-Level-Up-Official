		"description": "<p>At 20th level, you’ve developed mind games within mind games, and your plans run deep. You may spend a point of inspiration to reveal your master plan as an action. When your master plan is revealed, describe a theoretically possible sequence of events that has led to a suddenly revealed boon for you and your allies, however implausible.&nbsp;Some examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An underling working for the villain was actually your friend working undercover this entire time.</li>\n<li>The important item the enemy just got away with was actually a fake, only to reveal the real item.</li>\n<li>A character was actually a different character in disguise, only to reveal the real character.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This feature is highly subject to the Narrator’s discretion, and you should discuss your master plan with the Narrator before activating this feature and revealing it. Your story can be implausible but not impossible, and you must fully explain a reasonable rationale for how such a con was possible in your reveal. Once the Narrator approves of your changes and you reveal your master plan, your story becomes reality, potentially even retroactively changing events.&nbsp;Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you spend at least a week resting in a safe haven to plan out your next master plan.</p>",
