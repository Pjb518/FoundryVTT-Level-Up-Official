(Bright light becomes dim light, dim light becomes darkness, and darkness becomes magical darkness). You may suppress this darkness (no action required) or reactivate it as a bonus action. While this darkness is active, illusions within its area become more potent. Creatures witnessing an illusion in the area have disadvantage on saves to disbelieve them, and creatures failing such a save become rattled. Creatures attempting an Insight check on you also do so with disadvantage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
