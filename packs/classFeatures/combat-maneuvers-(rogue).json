You gain proficiency in two combat traditions from the following list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Biting Zephyr</li>\n<li>Mist and Shade</li>\n<li>Rapid Current</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You learn two maneuvers of your choice from traditions you are proficient with.</p>\n<p>You gain an exertion pool equal to twice your proficiency bonus, regaining any spent exertion at the end of a short or long rest. You use your maneuvers by spending points from your exertion pool.</p>\n<p>The Maneuvers Known column of the Rogue table shows when you learn more maneuvers from a tradition you are proficient with, while the Maneuver Degree column shows the highest degree you can select maneuvers from at a given level.</p>\n<p>Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same degree from a tradition you are proficient with.</p>",
