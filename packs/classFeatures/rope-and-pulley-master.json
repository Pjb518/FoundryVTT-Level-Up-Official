By spending 10 minutes working with at least 300 feet of rope, you can create the following through ingenious use of ropes and pulleys.</p><p>A rope system that provides safe travel over a gap of 50 feet or less. You must be able to access both sides of this gap to create a rope system in this way.</p><ul><li><p>A rope system that allows a creature to lift an object of a weight up to 5 × its carrying capacity directly up as far as 50 feet.</p></li><li><p>A rope system that allows a creature to drag an object of a weight up to 5 × its carrying capacity as far as 50 feet.</p></li><li><p>A manual rope elevator that allows a single Medium-sized or smaller creature to travel up to 50 feet straight up and down as if it were difficult terrain (a tree,<br>cliff wall, ceiling, or similar structure is required at the top of this elevator for the ropes to attach).</p></li></ul><p>You can also deconstruct and recover the rope used in any of these rope creations by spending 10 minutes tearing it down. <br></p>",
