This does not stack with similar bonuses from the Smith follower. Furthermore, armor made of wood that was crafted or treated by you reduces the severity of its Flaw; on a natural 1 on a Dexterity saving throw or being critically hit the item only becomes damaged, not broken, unless already damaged.</p>",
