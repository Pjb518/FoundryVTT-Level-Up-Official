				"description": "<p>Provided the target's soul is willing and able to return to its body, so long as it is not undead it returns to life with all of its hit points.</p>\n<p>The spell cures any poisons and nonmagical diseases that affected the target at the time of death.</p>\n<p>It does not remove any magical diseases, curses, or other magical effects; these must be removed prior to the spell being cast, otherwise they immediately take effect when the target returns to life. The spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.</p>\n<p>Being raised from the dead takes a toll on the body, mind, and spirit. The target takes a -4 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of each long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until the target completely recovers.</p>\n<p>Resurrecting a creature that has been dead for one year or longer is exhausting. Until you finish a long rest, you can't cast spells again and you have disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.</p>"
