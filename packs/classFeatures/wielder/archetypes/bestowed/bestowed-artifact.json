Work with your narrator to determine your benefactor, selecting a deity, demon lord, archfey, or being of similar power. At minimum, you must establish the alignment of your benefactor, and at least one directive. Your narrator may create a directive for you, or select one of the following:</p><ul><li><p>Spread my message far and wide.</p></li><li><p>Defeat a specific great threat and their minions.</p></li><li><p>Root out the heretic.</p></li><li><p>Meet out punishment for a great injustice.</p></li></ul><p>Your benefactor is an NPC controlled by the narrator and is the source of your bonded artifact’s power. Unless you are in conflict with your benefactor, you are always able to utilize your bonded artifact’s features. If you don’t make at least some effort towards achieving any of your benefactor’s directives for 24 hours, you will be in conflict with your benefactor until you appease them or make such efforts. While you are in conflict with your benefactor, you cannot cast any wielder spells or use any wielder features that require the use of artifact charges.</p><p>If you complete your directive, your benefactor may choose another one.</p><p></p>",
