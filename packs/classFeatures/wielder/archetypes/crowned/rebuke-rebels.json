When you cast a wielder spell that requires an initial Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, you may choose to deal an amount of psychic damage equal to 1d6 times the level of the spell to creatures who succeed on their saving throw. You may do likewise to creatures who are targeted but not affected by wielder spells you cast that affect creatures with a certain number of hit points.</span></p>",
