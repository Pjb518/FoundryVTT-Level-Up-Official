Starting at 10th level, so long as your bonded artifact is in your possession and not in conflict, you gain a bonus to your Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma checks and saving throws equal to your bonded artifact&rsquo;s corresponding modifiers. In addition, you are considered aware and conscious even when unconscious and you gain advantage on initiative checks.</p>",
