Use the rules for Creating Sentient Magic Items to create your artifact&rsquo;s personality and traits either by working with your narrator or determining the following randomly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma scores.</li>\n<li>A way it communicates to you or others.</li>\n<li>A way it senses its surroundings.</li>\n<li>A personality and potential source of conflict.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your bonded artifact is an NPC controlled by the narrator, but your bond is strong and unless you are in conflict with your artifact you are always able to utilize its features and direct any actions it can make. Your artifact acts on your turn in initiative.</p>\n<p>While you are in conflict with your artifact, you cannot cast any wielder spells or use any wielder features that require the use of artifact charges.</p>",
