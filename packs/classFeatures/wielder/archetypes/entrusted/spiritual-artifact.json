		"description": "<p>Starting at 6th level, you can animate your bonded artifact and allow it to act independently of you as a bonus action. While animated in this way your bonded artifact has a fly speed of 30 feet, and an AC equal to 10 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus.</p>\n<p>Whenever your bonded artifact would take damage while animated in this way, it instead loses one charge for every instance of damage taken. When your bonded artifact has no charges remaining or when you recall it as a bonus action, it vanishes and reappears in your possession (or in the case of armor of power, it reappears donned on you).</p>\n<p>On each of your turns while your bonded artifact is animated it may cast one wielder spell as if it were you and uses your statistics. If your bonded artifact is a weapon of power, it may instead choose to make an attack using your statistics.</p>\n<p>Visually your bonded artifact may appear as a ghostly version of the soul that now inhabits the artifact, the artifact may glow with magical power, or it may simply look as if the artifact is floating and moving freely but otherwise occupies space as if it were a medium-sized creature.</p>",
