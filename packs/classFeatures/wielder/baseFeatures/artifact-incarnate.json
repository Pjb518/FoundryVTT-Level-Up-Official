You gain benefits determined by your bonded artifact&rsquo;s form:</p>\n<h2>Weapon of Power Incarnate</h2>\n<p>Whenever you deal damage with your weapon of power you roll an additional damage die. (For example a longsword weapon of power would deal 2d8 slashing damage instead of 1d8 slashing damage.)</p>\n<h2>Armor of Power Incarnate</h2>\n<p>While wearing your armor of power you gain resistance to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</p>\n<h2>Font of Power Incarnate</h2>\n<p>The number of extra artifact charges gained from your font of power increases to twice your proficiency bonus.</p>",
