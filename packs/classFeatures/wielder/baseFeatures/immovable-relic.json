Other creatures find that your bonded artifact is fixed magically in place when they attempt to interact with it. Your bonded artifact obeys the laws of gravity but otherwise can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving your bonded artifact up to 10 feet on a success.</p>",
