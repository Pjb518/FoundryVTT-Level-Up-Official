		"description": "<p>A wielder&rsquo;s magic and supernatural abilities come not from themselves but rather their bonded artifact and their connection to it.</p>\n<h2>Artifact Charges</h2>\n<p>The Wielder table shows how many charges your artifact has. To cast one of your wielder spells of 1st-level or higher, you must spend a number of charges dependent on the spell's level, shown on the table below. You can also cast a spell you know at a higher spell level by spending the appropriate number of charges. The maximum spell level you can cast is shown in the Spell Level column of the Wielder table. You regain all expended charges when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Charges</h3>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Spell Level</td>\n<td>Charges</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>7</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Wielder spell list.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Spells Known column of the Wielder table shows when you learn more wielder spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level that you are able to cast. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st- or 2nd-level.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the wielder spells you know and replace it with another spell from the wielder spell list, which also must be of a level of which you can cast.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Spellcasting Ability</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Your connection to your bonded artifact empowers your spellcasting, and depending on your chosen Archetype your spellcasting ability may be either Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. You use the spellcasting ability shown in your Wielder&rsquo;s Bond whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use that ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wielder spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your chosen ability modifier</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your chosen ability modifier&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Artifact Focus</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Your bonded artifact acts as your spellcasting focus for your wielder spells.</p>",
