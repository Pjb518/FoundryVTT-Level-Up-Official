You add the spell @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.ap6klied8mqbclvn]{Enlarge/Reduce} to your list of known wielder spells. In addition, when you use a bonus action to enter your torchbearer form you may choose to cast the spell <em>enlarge/reduce</em> on yourself at 2nd level without expending any additional artifact charges as a part of the same bonus action. Spells you cast in this way end when you leave your torchbearer form.</p>",
