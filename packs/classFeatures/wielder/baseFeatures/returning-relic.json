Your weapon of power gains the thrown weapon quality with a range of 30/60. Whenever you make a thrown weapon attack using your weapon of power in this way it magically returns to your hand at the end of the attack. In addition, so long as your weapon of power is within 60 feet you can magically return it to your hand as a bonus action.</p>",
