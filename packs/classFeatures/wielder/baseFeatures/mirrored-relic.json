You add the spell @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.05w9nzp0kvu94k3h]{Mirror Image} to your list of known wielder spells. In addition, when you animate your bonded artifact using your spiritual artifact feature, you may choose to cast the spell <em>mirror image</em> on your bonded artifact at 2nd level without expending any additional artifact charges as a part of the same bonus action. Spells you cast in this way are treated as if your bonded artifact cast them on itself.</p>",
