When you gain this feature, your prestige rating increases by 1. In addition, whenever you fail a prestige check you may immediately roll [[/r 1d4]] and add it to the result, potentially turning a failure into a success. If you succeed on a prestige check in this way, the character has heard of your bonded artifact, but not you.</p>",
