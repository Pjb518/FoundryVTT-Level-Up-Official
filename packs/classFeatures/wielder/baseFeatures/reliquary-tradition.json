Choose a combat tradition you know maneuvers in, you can spend artifact charges for maneuvers of your chosen tradition as if they were exertion points at a cost of one charge per exertion point, instead of expending 2 charges per exertion point as normal using your charged exertion feature. You may select this relic art multiple times, choosing a different combat tradition each time.</p>",
