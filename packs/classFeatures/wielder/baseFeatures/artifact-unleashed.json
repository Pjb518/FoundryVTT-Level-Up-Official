You gain benefits determined by your bonded artifact&rsquo;s form:</p>\n<h2>Unleashed Weapon of Power</h2>\n<p>Attacks you make with your weapon of power ignore all resistances and immunities. In addition, once per turn when you hit a target with your weapon of power you may choose to expend one artifact charge to deal an additional 4d6 force damage.</p>\n<h2>Unleashed Armor of Power</h2>\n<p>While wearing your armor of power, as an action you can project a shield of impenetrable force that protects you until the start of your next turn by expending three artifact charges. While this shield is projected you are immune to all damage types.</p>\n<h2>Unleashed Font of Power</h2>\n<p>You may cast up to 3 wielder spells with your font of power using a single action so long as each spell has a casting time of action or bonus action. You may resolve these spells in any order.</p>",
