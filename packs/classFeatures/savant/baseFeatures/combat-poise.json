		"description": "<p>Some savants are prepared to bloody their knuckles in a fight, while others make a point of staying out of the scrum. At 2nd level, you choose one of the following poises.</p>\n<h2>A Step Ahead</h2>\n<p>You have a deft ability to predict your opponents&rsquo; responses and interfere with them. Whenever a creature within your reach that you are aware of attempts to take a reaction, you can expend your reaction for the round to try to disrupt them. That creature must make an Intelligence saving throw against your trick DC. If they fail, their reaction is wasted.</p>\n<h2>Combat Maneuvers</h2>\n<p>You gain the ability to use combat maneuvers. (Combat maneuvers are detailed in the Level Up Adventurer&rsquo;s Guide.) You gain an exertion point pool equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>\n<p>Choose two martial traditions. (Most savants learn maneuvers of the traditions Biting Zephyr, Mist and Shade, Rapid Current, or Sanguine Knot.) Whenever you gain a savant trick, you can instead choose a maneuver from any of your chosen martial traditions.</p>\n<p>You can initially learn maneuvers of the 1st degree. At 7th level you gain access to 2nd degree maneuvers, then at 13th level you can access 3rd degree maneuvers, and finally at 19th level you can access 4th degree maneuvers.</p>",
