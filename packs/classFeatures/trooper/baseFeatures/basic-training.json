At 2nd level, choose one of the following options.</p>\n<h2>Chains of Command</h2>\n<p>You know who’s in charge—and more importantly, who’s really in charge of an organization (such as a police precinct) or group of individuals (such as a party of rival voidrunners). If you have encountered an organization's leader, you know who’s officially in charge according to that group’s chain of command, as well as the attitudes of each of the group’s members towards their leader.</p>\n<h2>Soldier of Fortune</h2>\n<p>You’ve worked (or currently work) as a mercenary, taking part in military conflicts for personal profit. Anyone in need of a little extra muscle may come to you with job offers, and you have advantage on ability checks you make to find such jobs or negotiate their terms. The jobs may involve some measure of danger, and they may not pay particularly well. But you’re never out of work, at least not for long.</p>\n<h2>War Stories</h2>\n<p>Even soldiers who haven’t fought together often share similar experiences. If you spend a few minutes swapping stories from your past with someone from a military background, you have advantage on the next Persuasion check you make to influence them.</p>",
