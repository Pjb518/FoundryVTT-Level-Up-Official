Regardless of your Prestige score, your Prestige Center covers an entire planet, or even multiple planets, at the Narrator’s discretion. In addition, prominent politicians, businesspeople, and celebrities come to you asking for favors and may be willing to perform favors for you in return. The Narrator determines the nature of these interactions. For example, the head of a shipping conglomerate may arrange transport for you and your companions to one of their off-planet facilities in return for a review of the facility’s security. Similarly, if you endorse a politician’s run for office, they may open doors for you in the future.</p>",
