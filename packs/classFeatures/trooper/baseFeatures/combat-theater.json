At 6th level, choose one of the following options.</p>\n<h2>Crowd Control</h2>\n<p>With a few simple, barked commands, you can impose order on an otherwise unruly crowd. You gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks.</p>\n<h2>Finger on the Trigger</h2>\n<p>Sometimes polite requests must be backed up with threats of violence. When one of your allies makes a Persuasion check, you can use your reaction to ready your firearm or brush the hilt of your blade. If the target of the Persuasion check can see you, your ally gains an expertise die on the check.</p>\n<h2>Hearts and Minds</h2>\n<p>It is a sad fact of war that the innocent are often caught in the crossfire, but you do your best to keep them safe. When you make efforts to keep a non-combatant out of harm’s way, word of your heroism spreads, and any members of their community who were previously indifferent to you become friendly.</p>",
