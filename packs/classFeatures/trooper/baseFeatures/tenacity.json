Choose one of the following options.</p>\n<h2>Cool Under Pressure</h2>\n<p>Regardless of the pressures placed upon you, you somehow manage to keep it together. You have advantage on saving throws against effects that inflict strife or mental stress, as well as on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration.</p>\n<h2>Indomitable Soul</h2>\n<p>You never back down, not while lives hang in the balance. While you are bloodied, you can use a bonus action on your turn to gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your trooper level. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute. While the temporary hit points last, you are immune to the frightened and rattled conditions. If you are frightened or rattled when you use this ability, the effects of these conditions are suspended until the end of this effect. Rounds spent under the influence of Indomitable Soul count towards the duration of these frightened and rattled conditions.</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h2>Tireless Loyalty</h2>\n<p>Nothing can convince you to turn on those you’ve promised to protect or break the ideals you’ve sworn to uphold. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed. While you are charmed by a condition that allows a saving throw at the end of your turn, you can choose to make the save at the start of your turn instead.</p>",
