At 1st level, choose a specific category of weapon, such as light mauls, medium casters, or cannons. You can also choose a miscellaneous weapon (such bio-chakram or combat chainsaw) as your favored ordnance.</p>\n<p>Attacks you make with your favored ordnance deal an additional 1d4 damage of the weapon’s type. Your favored ordnance damage applies only to damage that requires an attack roll. Thus, you can’t increase the damage dealt by a grenade or a weapon’s burst property, unless you have a special ability that allows you to do so. This extra damage increases as you gain trooper levels, as shown in the Favored Ordnance column of the Trooper table. Once you deal your favored ordnance damage, you can’t do so again until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of your favored ordnance selections with another weapon.</p>",
