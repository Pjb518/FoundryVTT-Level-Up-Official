		"description": "<p>Also at 7th level, enemies who face you on the battlefield soon realize they’re outmatched. You learn one of the following expert techniques. Whenever you use the Attack action while wielding one of your @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.vKckTQevhrZgeJJ9]{Favored Ordnance} weapons, you can attempt an expert technique that you know in place of an attack. When you successfully use an expert technique, you can choose to deal your favored ordnance damage to the target, even if another feature (such as your @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.bkY6poWewegEf0LB]{Barrage} feature) would otherwise cause you to forgo your favored ordnance damage.</p>\n<h2>Demoralizing Knockdown</h2>\n<p>Your attack knocks the target flat on its back. If the target is no more than one size category larger than you, it makes a Strength saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failure, you deal your favored ordnance damage and knock the target prone. In addition, the target is rattled until the end of your next turn. While rattled, the target can’t stand up, though it can crawl.</p>\n<h2>Disquieting Disarm</h2>\n<p>You attempt to knock an item or weapon from a creature’s hand. The target makes a Strength or Dexterity saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failure, you deal your favored ordnance damage and the target drops the item in its space. In addition, the target is rattled until the end of your next turn. Creatures that are a size category larger than you or that are holding the item with at least two hands have advantage on this save, while a creature of a size category smaller than you has disadvantage. While rattled, the target must use an action to recover its weapon or draw a new one.</p>\n<h2>Exposing Shove</h2>\n<p>Your attack staggers your target, exposing it to follow-up attacks. If the target is one size category larger than you or smaller, it makes a Strength saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failure, you deal your favored ordnance damage and push the target a number of feet away from you equal to 5 + 5 for every 5 points it failed its saving throw by. In addition, the target is rattled until the end of your next turn. While rattled, attack rolls against the target are made with advantage.</p>",
