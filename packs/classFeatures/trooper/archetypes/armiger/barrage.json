If you do, you do not apply your favored ordnance damage to any attacks made using that attack action.</p>\n<p>At 16th level, you can forgo your favored ordnance damage to make two additional attacks. Alternatively, you can make one additional attack, but if you do, you reduce your favored ordnance damage to [[/r 1d12]] for both attacks.</p>",
