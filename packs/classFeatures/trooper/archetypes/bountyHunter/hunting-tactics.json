		"description": "<p>Starting at 7th level, you develop tactics needed for tracking down and subduing your bounties. You learn one of the following features.</p>\n<h2>Eye for Faces</h2>\n<p>No matter the disguise, once you get a read on your mark youâ€™d know it anywhere. By spending at least a minute chatting with and closely observing a creature, you can memorize it and its mannerisms. You can instantly and accurately recognize any creature you memorize in this way, and you can automatically see through any disguise it uses so long as you are able to both see it and hear it speak. In addition, you gain an expertise die on Insight checks.</p>\n<h2>Self-Reliant</h2>\n<p>Bounty hunters are often on their own for months at a time as they follow the trail. You gain a 1d6 expertise die on any check made to hunt or gather food, and you do not suffer levels of fatigue due to travel pace. In addition, you are immune to the effects of roughing it and gain an expertise die on Survival checks.</p>\n<h2>Skilled Tracker</h2>\n<p>Whenever you make a Perception check or Survival check to track or to perform the Track journey activity and the d20 result is less than 10, you can count the d20 result as being 10.</p>",
