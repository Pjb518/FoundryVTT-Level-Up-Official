		"description": "<p>Also at 7th level, you develop advanced tactics that allow you to direct the ebb and flow of battle with your gunfire. You learn one of the following advanced tactics, which you can use to augment the burst areas you create with firearms. You can’t use more than one advanced tactic on your turn. If you use @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.V7Fqs64S9QH4hszm]{Strafe} to create multiple burst areas, the advanced tactic you use (if any) applies to all areas you create.</p>\n<h2>Cover Fire</h2>\n<p>When you use the burst property with a firearm, you can choose to exclude a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus from the burst’s effect. All other targets have advantage on the Dexterity saving throw they make to avoid damage from the burst. After the burst’s effect is resolved, the creatures you excluded can use their reaction to move up to half their Speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>\n<h2>Focus Fire</h2>\n<p>When you use the burst property with a firearm, you can choose to create a 5-foot-cube area instead of a 10 foot cube. If you do, targets in the burst take additional damage equal to your favored ordnance damage (an extra 1d8 at 7th level, and extra 1d12 at 11th level, and an extra 2d12 at 16th level). If you use this tactic in conjunction with your Strafe feature, any additional burst areas you create are also 5 foot cubes.</p>\n<h2>Suppressive Fire</h2>\n<p>When you use the burst property with a firearm, instead of the burst’s normal effects, you can choose to fill the area with suppressive fire. Each creature in the area makes a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failure, the creature is rattled and has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls until the end of your next turn.</p>",
