		"description": "<p>Also at 7th level, you develop infiltration tactics that allow you to operate deep within hostile territory. You learn one of the following features.</p>\n<h2>Dark Ops</h2>\n<p>You can see normally in darkness to a range of 60 feet. If you already have or gain darkvision from some other source, the range of your darkvision instead increases by 60 feet. In addition, when you are in dim light (or darker) and a weapon attack hits you, you can use your reaction to roll your favored ordnance die, reducing the damage by the result.</p>\n<h2>Ghost Protocols</h2>\n<p>Whenever you make a Stealth check and the d20 result is less than 10, your roll is treated as a 10.</p>\n<h2>Silent Takedown</h2>\n<p>Whenever you successfully grapple a creature, you can choose to make that grapple silently. When you do, the creature you grapple cannot speak or make any loud noises while it remains grappled. Grapples can be attempted in this way while hidden. Creatures you grapple while hidden also become hidden, using your Stealth check as its own.</p>",
