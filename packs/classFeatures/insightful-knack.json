On a success, you notice something of significance, such as a coded message, a secret door, a hidden chest, or the tracks or other signs of a nearby creature. The nature of the information you intuit depends on the location you are in&mdash;the Narrator can always decide there is nothing for you to intuit about your current location or may offer a clue leading to a more relevant location instead. Once you have learned something with this feature, you must finish a&nbsp;<span class=\"freelinking-link\">long rest</span> before you can do so again.</p>",
