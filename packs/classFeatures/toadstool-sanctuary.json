		"description": "<p>At 10th level, you gain the power to open a tiny fissure into the Dreaming which serves as a wellspring of revitalizing energy. When you are in a forest, woodlands, or other healthy greenspace, you can dance, sing, or chant for 1 minute to spring forth a circle of mushrooms in the unoccupied space around you. The mushroom circle can have a radius of up to 15 feet (minimum diameter 5 feet). Creatures resting in your toadstool sanctuary for 10 minutes gain the&nbsp; benefits of a short rest.</p><p>Your toadstool sanctuary lasts for 1 week, or until you use this feature again. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Creatures who benefit from your toadstool sanctuary cannot do so again for 24 hours.</p>",
