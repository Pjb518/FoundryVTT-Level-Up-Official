While you are raging, whenever you move, you deal 1d6 thunder damage to all creatures that are on the ground and occupying or adjacent to squares you move through. You (and your mount, if applicable) are unaffected by this damage, as are other creatures with this archetype and their mounts. A target can only be affected by this damage once from any given creature in a round.</p>",
