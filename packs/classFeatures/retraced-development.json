With 1 hour of work you can create ramshackle versions of any type of artisan’s tools out of wood and stone. You take a –2 penalty on checks made with these ramshackle tools, only you can make use of them, and they have no sale value, but you can use them just like normal versions of those tools and they can also be used as tools of artifice. <br></p>",
