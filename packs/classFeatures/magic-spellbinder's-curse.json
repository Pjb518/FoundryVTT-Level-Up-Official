    "description": "<p>You can use a bonus action to place a curse on a creature you can see within 30 feet. The curse lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if the target dies, you die, or you become incapacitated. The curse has the following effects:</p><ul><li><p>Choose lightning damage or thunder damage. When you deal damage against the cursed creature, it takes an additional 1d4 damage of the chosen type. This bonus increases by 1d4 at 10th level, and again at 15th and 20th level.</p></li><li><p>You gain a pool of faerie dice, which begins empty. Each faerie die represents a bit of good fortune from your patron. When the cursed creature makes an ability check or attack roll with disadvantage, add one faerie die to this pool. You can spend a faerie die when making an ability check or attack roll to gain a 1d4 bonus. The pool disappears when you finish a short or long rest.</p></li></ul><p>Once you have used this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
