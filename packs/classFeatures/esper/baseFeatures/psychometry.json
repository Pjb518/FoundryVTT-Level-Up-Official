		"description": "<p>At 4th level you gain the ability to glean information about people, places, or objects in your vicinity, typically these impressions are faint, but if you touch the target, you gain more information. You may choose People, Places, or Things when you gain this ability, and may change it at the end of a long rest.</p><p><strong>People</strong>: You are more aware of important events that have happened in a person’s life, and can make contact with spirits related to them. You gain Expertise on Insight and Perception checks to gain information about a person. You may also use @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.6ia3gup3j0m6oigb]{Speak with Dead} as a Ritual with no components to ask questions of a spirit related to a being you are in physical contact with about their life and choices. This spirit can be any deceased relative, close friend, or dire enemy and negates the need for a corpse to target.</p><p><strong>Places</strong>: You are aware of important events that have happened in a location. When you make a DC 15 Investigation check to search an area, you can recognize if any of the following conditions are met in the area searched: Any creature from another plane has passed through the area within the last hour. Any creature has died in the area within the last 100 years and how long ago it was. Any creature has experienced intense emotional trauma in the area within the last 24 hours. Any supernatural effects are at play in the area (e.g. a magical or psionic illusion, aura, or ward).</p><p><strong>Things</strong>: You learn a great deal about the people who owned an object. By holding an object you can spend an action to learn if it was used to harm anyone within the past week, or if it was present during a time of emotional turmoil. You may commune with the object over the course of 10 minutes to witness a specific event, or series of events, that the object was present for in the last five years. During these 10 minutes you are unable to see the world around you, though you may still hear and speak normally, even narrating events as they play out in the vision.</p>",
