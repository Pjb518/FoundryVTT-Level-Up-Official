These attacks use the weapon&rsquo;s range increments as normal.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cantrips cast in this way take the shape of mystic arrows, bolts, throwing weapons, or bullets, and any somatic components are replaced by the act of aiming and firing or throwing the weapon. So long as you possess at least one Javelin, Throwing Axe, Throwing Dagger, or other thrown weapon you may create such throwing weapons with Arcane Ammunition.</p>",
