Once a month, you can perform a special ritual requiring you to take 2 levels of fatigue and 2 levels of strife and 8 hours of uninterrupted work to blight a wide swath of territory. Upon the successful completion of the ritual, all of the vegetation and creatures weighing less than 5 pounds within a 5-mile radius immediately die and begin decomposing into putrid, toxic ichor. Creatures weighing more than 5 pounds must make a Constitution save against your spell save DC or gain a level of fatigue. Nothing will grow in this area again for a year unless it is ritually purified, which takes a 100gp of reagents and a month of 8-hour days of ritual work from trained spellcasters per affected square mile. At the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion, other methods such as divine intervention, the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.r6eshb9jaeqc70mp]{Hallow}<em>&nbsp;</em>spell, or similar means may also be able to end the curse.</p>",
