Choose one of the following features:</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Maritime Terror</strong></h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All of your attacks and spells gain the Breaker weapon property against water vehicles, and you gain advantage on checks to maintain a grapple while you are in water. Also while in contact with a body of water of at least Large size, you gain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus at the beginning of each of your turns.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Maritime Guardian</strong></h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At your option, a water vehicle you ride gains resistance to bludgeoning, lightning, piercing, slashing, and thunder damage. You also gain advantage on Perception and Insight checks to detect threats to the vehicle or its occupants. Spells you cast that restore hit points can also target the vehicle to repair damage, even if the vehicle would not normally be a valid target for the spell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
