Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals damage, you gain a life die. Both of these dice start as d4s, and if you cast the appropriate type of spell while you already have one its size increases by one step, to a maximum of a d12. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points you can spend your life die to roll it and add it to one healing roll for the spell. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals damage you can spend your death die to roll it and add it to one damage roll for the spell.</p>",
