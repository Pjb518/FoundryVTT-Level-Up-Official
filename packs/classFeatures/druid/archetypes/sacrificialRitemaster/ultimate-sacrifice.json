The spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.</p><p>Being raised from the dead takes a toll on the body, mind, and spirit. The target takes a -4 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks.</p><p>At the conclusion of each long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until the target completely recovers.</p><p>Resurrecting a creature that has been dead for one year or longer is exhausting. Until you finish a long rest, you can't cast spells again and you have disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.</p>",
