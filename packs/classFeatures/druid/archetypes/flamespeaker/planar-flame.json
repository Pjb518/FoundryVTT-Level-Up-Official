Choose one of the following options when you gain this feature:</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Heavenly Fire</strong></h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you deal fire damage or radiant damage, at your option you can have that damage dealt be half fire damage and half radiant damage. <br>In addition, you may choose to have your fire spells heal rather than harming, restoring hit points equal to half the damage they would normally do. You may use this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus and regain all uses upon finishing a long rest.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Hellfire</strong></h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you deal fire damage or necrotic damage, at your option you can have that damage dealt be half fire damage and half necrotic damage.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, you may have your flames burn away the life essence of creatures. When you deal fire damage to a creature, you can use this feature (no action required) to decrease the creature&rsquo;s maximum hit points by an amount equal to the fire damage it dealt. You can use this feature a number of times per day equal to half your proficiency bonus, and you regain all uses upon finishing a long rest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
