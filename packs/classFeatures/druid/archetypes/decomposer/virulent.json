It is blinded and has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and saving throws.</p></li><li><p><strong>Filth Fever:</strong> The target is wracked by fever. It has disadvantage when using Strength for an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.</p></li><li><p><strong>Flesh Rot:</strong> The target's flesh rots. It has disadvantage on Charisma ability checks and becomes vulnerable to all damage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mindfire:</strong> The target hallucinates. During combat it is confused, and it has disadvantage when using Intelligence for an ability check or saving throw.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rattling Cough:</strong> The target becomes discombobulated as it hacks with body-wracking coughs. It is rattled and has disadvantage when using Dexterity for an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.</p></li><li><p><strong>Slimy Doom:</strong> The target bleeds uncontrollably. It has disadvantage when using Constitution for an ability check or saving throw. Whenever it takes damage, the target is stunned until the end of its next turn.</p></li></ul>",

You can be a carrier of only one disease at a time. While you are a carrier of a disease, the disease does not affect you, but it remains dormant in your system. When you touch a&nbsp;bloodied&nbsp;creature or hit it with a melee weapon attack, you can force the creature to make a Constitution&nbsp;saving throw&nbsp;against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature contracts the disease you carry.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you always have the<em> </em>@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.vms65nmhqqgu9b2w]{Contagion} spell prepared, and you can cast it without expending a spell slot.
