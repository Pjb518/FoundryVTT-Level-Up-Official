		"description": "<p>At 10th level, you can repurpose disease as a tool of decomposition. When you would contract a nonmagical disease, you can choose to become a carrier of the disease instead. You can be a carrier of only one disease at a time. While you are a carrier of a disease, the disease does not affect you, but it remains dormant in your system. When you touch a&nbsp;bloodied</span>&nbsp;creature or hit it with a melee weapon attack, you can force the creature to make a Constitution&nbsp;saving throw</span>&nbsp;against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature contracts the disease you carry.</p><p>Additionally, you always have the<em>&nbsp;contagion&nbsp;</em>spell prepared, and you can cast it without expending a spell slot. Once you&rsquo;ve cast&nbsp;<em>contagion</em>&nbsp;in this way, you must finish a&nbsp;<span>long rest&nbsp;before you can do so again. When you cast&nbsp;<em>contagion</em>, you can choose to spread the&nbsp;<span>disease you&rsquo;re carrying, instead of one of the diseases presented in the spell&rsquo;s description.</p>",
