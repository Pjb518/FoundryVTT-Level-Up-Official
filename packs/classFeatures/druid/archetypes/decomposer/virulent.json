You can be a carrier of only one disease at a time. While you are a carrier of a disease, the disease does not affect you, but it remains dormant in your system. When you touch a&nbsp;bloodied&nbsp;creature or hit it with a melee weapon attack, you can force the creature to make a Constitution&nbsp;saving throw&nbsp;against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature contracts the disease you carry.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you always have the<em> </em>@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.vms65nmhqqgu9b2w]{Contagion} spell prepared, and you can cast it without expending a spell slot. Once you&rsquo;ve cast&nbsp;<em>contagion</em>&nbsp;in this way, you must finish a&nbsp;long rest&nbsp;before you can do so again. When you cast&nbsp;<em>contagion</em>, you can choose to spread the&nbsp;disease you&rsquo;re carrying, instead of one of the diseases presented in the spell&rsquo;s description.</p>",
