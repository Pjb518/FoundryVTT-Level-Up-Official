While in your normal form or swarm form, you can use an action to touch the corpse of a Medium or larger creature that has been dead for 10 days or less and magically regain one expended spell slot. The spell slot you regain can&rsquo;t be higher than 5th&nbsp; level or half your character level, whichever is lower. When you use this ability, the corpse you touch rapidly decomposes and becomes unrecognizable. You can&rsquo;t use this feature again until you finish a&nbsp;short or long rest.</p>",
