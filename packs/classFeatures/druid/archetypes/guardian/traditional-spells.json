You can select up to two additional traditional spells from those schools when you reach 7th, 9th, and 11th level in this class. You always have your traditional spells prepared, and they don&rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you select a spell that doesn&rsquo;t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is a druid spell for you.</p>",
