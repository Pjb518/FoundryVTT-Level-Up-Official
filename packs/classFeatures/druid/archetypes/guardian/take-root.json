As a series of rituals requiring 24 hours of uninterrupted work, you can take root in a specific community such as a village, city, or commune, or a place of magical importance such as a temple, revered grove, or convergence of leylines. You may cast the spell <strong>Transport</strong> <strong>via Plants </strong>to travel to the place you’ve taken root without expending a spell slot. In addition, while within a mile of the place you’ve taken root, you may cast the spell <strong>Tree Stride </strong>without expending a spell slot. </p><p>These effects end when you attempt to take root in a new location.</p>",
