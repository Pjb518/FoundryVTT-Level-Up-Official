In addition, you can cast plant growth without expending a spell slot when casting the spell using the Enlarged option.</p>\n<h2>Traditional Spells</h2>\n<p>When you first gain this feature, select three spells from the air, beasts, earth, healing, nature, plants, terrain, water, or weather schools as your traditional spells. You can select up to two additional traditional spells from those schools when you reach 7th, 9th, and 11th level in this class. You always have your traditional spells prepared, and they don&rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you select a spell that doesn&rsquo;t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is a druid spell for you.</p>\n<h2>Transfer Vitality</h2>\n<p>You can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to cast cure wounds at a spell level equal to one-third your druid level. In addition, once between long rests, when you restore a creature&rsquo;s hit points, you can choose to restore twice as many hit points as normal.</p>",
