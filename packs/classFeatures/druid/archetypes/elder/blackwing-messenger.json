		"description": "<p>At 10th level, you gain the ability to wild shape into a special raven form that does not count against your wild shapes known. This special form has a few advantages over a normal raven form:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You can speak either in your normal voice or a raven&rsquo;s squawking voice as you see fit. You also can communicate telepathically within 100 feet.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>While you are in raven form, you may cast the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.jo2vztvypvhqxh5u]{Dream} spell once. This locks you into your raven form until the spell ends, and you must be the messenger. You appear to the target as your raven form, but you may choose to have the target know your identity if you wish.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your flight speed is 120 feet rather than the normal 50-foot speed of a raven.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Instead of a raven&rsquo;s normal beak attack, you have an improved one. Your to-hit modifier is the sum of your Wisdom bonus and Proficiency bonus, and the attack deals 1d4 piercing + your choice of radiant or necrotic damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If raven was already one of your wild shape forms, you may select another one to replace it when you gain access to this feature.&nbsp;</p>",
