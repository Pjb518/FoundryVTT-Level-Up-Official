As an action you can expend a use of Wild Shape to cause yourself or a creature you’ve summoned to give off a noxious miasma in a 10-foot radius for the next minute. Whenever a non-plant creature other than you starts its turn within the miasma’s radius or moves there for the first time on its turn, it must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be poisoned until the start of its next turn.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p>If you do not meet any of the prerequisites, instead you gain an additional Primal Vitality and an additional Ingrained Vitality feature you haven’t previously selected.</p>",
