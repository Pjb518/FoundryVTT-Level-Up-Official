The knowledge and understanding of such things are limited - such as a creature that has been dead for some time might be able to tell you about where it lived, or what killed it, but could not tell you anything about the nearby town that didn&rsquo;t exist at the time of its demise. The creatures are in no way obligated to respond to the druid.&nbsp;</p>",
