When you take the scout journey activity while traveling through grasslands, hills, forests, or jungles, on a success or critical success you additionally locate a safe glade. Safe glades you find in this way count as havens. You may only use this ability once per region, but you can always relocate safe glades you have found in the past.</p>",
