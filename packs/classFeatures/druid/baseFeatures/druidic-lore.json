		"description": "<p>At 7th level, your knowledge of the natural world grows. Choose one of the following:</p><h3>Druidic Secrets</h3><p>You&rsquo;re adept at covertly performing druidic magic without attracting attention. When you cast a druid spell you may choose to do so utilizing silent and subtle Druidic motions and signs in place of both the spell&rsquo;s seen and vocalized components, gestures that creatures which can speak Druidic are aware of. Once you cast a druid spell in this way, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Toxin Intuition</h3><p>You are a veteran of nature&rsquo;s chemical warfare. You automatically know if any flora or fauna is poisonous or venomous. In addition, you gain advantage on checks made to determine if a foodstuff is poisonous and saving throws against poison.</p><h3>Truthspeaker</h3><p>You&rsquo;ve learned to tap into the fundamental truth that connects all things, at least briefly.</p><p>You may cast the spell legend lore without expending a spell slot and without material components. Once you cast the spell in this way, you cannot do so again for the next 24 hours.</p><h3>Waste Not</h3><p>With 10 minutes work you can scavenge valuable cuts from the corpse of a beast, dragon, monstrosity, or plant that has a CR of 1 or higher and has died within the last hour. If sold to a collector, naturalist, or other druid, this notable component is worth an amount of gold equal to 5 &times; the creature&rsquo;s CR.</p>",
