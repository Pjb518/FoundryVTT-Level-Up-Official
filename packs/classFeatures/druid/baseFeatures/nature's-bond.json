				"description": "<p>Your familiar, a spirit that takes the form of any CR 0 beast of Small or Tiny size, appears in an unoccupied space within range. It has the statistics of the chosen form, but is your choice of a celestial, fey, or fiend (instead of a beast).</p><p>Your familiar is an independent creature that rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn in combat (but cannot take the Attack action). However, it is loyal to you and always obeys your commands.</p><p>When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it vanishes without a trace. Casting the spell again causes it to reappear.</p><p>You are able to communicate telepathically with your familiar when it is within 100 feet. As long as it is within this range, you can use an action to see through your familiar's eyes and hear through its ears until the beginning of your next turn, gaining the benefit of any special senses it has. During this time, you are blind and deaf to your body's surroundings.</p><p>You can use an action to either permanently dismiss your familiar or temporarily dismiss it to a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. While it is temporarily dismissed, you can use an action to call it back, causing it to appear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.</p><p>You can't have more than one familiar at a time, but if you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you can cause it to adopt a different form.</p><p>Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of Touch and your familiar is within 100 feet of you, it can deliver the spell as if it was the spellcaster. Your familiar must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, use your attack bonus for the spell.</p>",
