You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid Spells table.</p><h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3><p>The Druid Spells table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Casting spells doesn&rsquo;t remove them from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells whenever you finish a long rest by meditating for at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p><h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3><p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><h3>Ritual Casting</h3><p>You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p><h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3><p>You can use a nature focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>",
