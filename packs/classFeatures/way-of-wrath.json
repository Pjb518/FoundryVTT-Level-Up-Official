    "description": "<p>For every berserker there is the spark of rage, ready to be fanned to inferno. The ways they use it however and how it came to be there can differ wildly. Some call upon their bloodline for inner strength, while others force it to a point of furious focus; many attribute it to the spirits that surround them. Still more gain their fury from a far more mundane source, such as betrayal or ill-treatment.</p><p>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that defines the source of your rage. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p><p>Dreadnaught</p><p>Rager</p><p>Tempest</p>",
