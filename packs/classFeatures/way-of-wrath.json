Some call upon their bloodline for inner strength, while others force it to a point of furious focus; many attribute it to the spirits that surround them. Still more gain their fury from a far more mundane source, such as betrayal or ill-treatment.</p><p>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that defines the source of your rage. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p><p>Dreadnaught</p><p>Rager</p><p>Tempest</p>",
