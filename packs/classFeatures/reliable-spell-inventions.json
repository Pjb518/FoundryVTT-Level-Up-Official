Whenever you roll a 1 on the fizzle die, you may reroll it, if you do you must use the new result.</p><p>In addition, your spell inventions have become streamlined enough that other creatures can make sense of them. A creature holding one of your spell inventions can use an action to make an Engineering check (DC equal to your spell save DC). On a success the spell is cast at its lowest possible spell level, or on a failure the spell fizzles out and fails to cast. Whenever a creature attempts to cast a spell using one of your spell inventions in this way, roll the fizzle die as normal.</p>",
