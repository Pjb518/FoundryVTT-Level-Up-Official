		"description": "<p>At 14th level, you can seek the aid of higher powers in your time of need. As an action, you urge the spirits of fire to intervene, and roll 1d100. If the result is equal to or lower than your wizard level, the intervention comes immediately. If not, the spirits make a demand in turn (which may be a high price) and do not intervene until the price is paid. The Narrator determines the price, and the exact nature of the intervention, though a wizard spell of any level is usually appropriate. If intervention occurs, this feature can’t be used again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can try again after a long rest. The complete scope of this power is dependent on the Narrator’s discretion—for a high enough price, anything is possible. </p><p>Finally, your insight into fire magic deepens as a result of your connection to fire spirits. If you can find a written record of it, you can copy any fire spell into your spellbook as if it were a wizard spell. Once you do, it is a wizard spell for you.</p>",
