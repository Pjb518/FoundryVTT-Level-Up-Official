		"description": "<p>At 6th level, you learn to infuse your spells with poison. As part of casting a spell, you may poison the magic of the spell. This requires a dose of advanced poison as an additional material component. For a spell that requires a saving throw, if a creature fails its saving throw, it takes an additional 2d6 points of poison damage and is Poisoned for one minute. If the spell requires an attack roll, on a hit the target takes an additional 2d6 points of damage. If the spell transports you from one place to another, you leave a cloud of poisonous vapor that persists for one minute behind in your starting square. A creature that starts their turn in that space or enters it must make a Constitution save against your spell save DC, taking 2d6 points of poison damage and becoming Poisoned for a minute on a failed save. A creature that succeeds on its save takes half damage and is not Poisoned. A creature suffering the Poisoned condition from this ability may make a Constitution save against your spell save DC at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on a success. Once you have used this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
