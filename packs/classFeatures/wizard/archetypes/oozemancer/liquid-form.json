		"description": "<p>At 10th level, you learn revolting arcane secrets that allow you to transform your body into slime. As a bonus action, you can adopt a liquid form. You revert to your normal form after 1 minute, if you are&nbsp;incapacitated</span>, or if you use another bonus action to end the effect early. Once you have used this ability, you must finish a&nbsp;short or long rest&nbsp;before you can do so again. In liquid form, your statistics are unchanged except for one of the following options, which you choose when you transform:</p><ul><li>You liquefy your bones, organs, and equipment to gain an amorphous form. While you are amorphous, you can pass through an opening as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. While in this form, you can&rsquo;t use or gain any benefit from your equipment.</li><li>You liquefy your skin, causing your body and equipment to become covered with a viscous, sticky slime. While you are coated in this way, you leave slimy, wet prints on objects and surfaces you touch or walk upon. You gain a climb speed equal to your Speed and can walk on walls and upside down on ceilings.&nbsp; Additionally, when a creature within 5 feet hits you with a melee attack, it is covered with slime. The creature has&nbsp;<span>disadvantage on the next attack it makes before the end of its next turn.</li></ul>",
