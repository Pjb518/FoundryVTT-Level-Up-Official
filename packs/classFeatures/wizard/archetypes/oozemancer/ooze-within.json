Whenever you are subjected to a critical hit, the hit is treated as a normal hit instead. In addition, you are immune to @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.4727pnvz5nwn3h23]{Sneak Attack} damage from class features or traits. Finally, you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws you make to escape a grapple.</p>",
