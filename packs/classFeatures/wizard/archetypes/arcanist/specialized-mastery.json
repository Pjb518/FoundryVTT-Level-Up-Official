Choose one of the following benefits:</p>\n<h2>Battle Hardiness</h2>\n<p>When concentrating on a wizard spell from your chosen school, you reduce incoming bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage by an amount equal to the level of the spell.</p>\n<h2>Heightened Potency</h2>\n<p>When you cast a wizard spell from your chosen school, it is always treated as though it were cast with a spell slot one level higher (maximum 9th-level) than the one you used, so long as you expended a spell slot to cast it. The slot you use to cast the spell must still be at least equal to the level of the spell.</p>\n<h2>Precise Understanding</h2>\n<p>When you see a creature cast a spell from your chosen school, you automatically know what spell it&rsquo;s casting. You also have advantage on saving throws against spells.</p>",
