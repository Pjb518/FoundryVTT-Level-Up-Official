Choose one of the following benefits:</p>\n<h2>Arcane Armor</h2>\n<p>When you cast a wizard spell of 1st-level or higher, you store some of its magic to protect yourself, gaining temporary hit points equal to twice the level of the spell, or three times the spell&rsquo;s level if the spell is from your chosen school. Instead of gaining these temporary hit points yourself, you can use your reaction to grant them to a creature within 30 feet.</p>\n<h2>Energy Retention</h2>\n<p>When you expend a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher to cast a wizard spell from your chosen school, you regain one expended spell slot. The regained spell slot must be of a level no more than half the level of the expended spell slot.</p>\n<h2>War Magic</h2>\n<p>When you deal damage with a wizard spell from your chosen school, you deal additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier on the first damage roll for that spell.</p>",
