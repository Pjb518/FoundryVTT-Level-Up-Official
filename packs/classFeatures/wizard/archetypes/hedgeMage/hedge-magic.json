Only other Hedge Mages can copy them from your spellbook, however. You also permanently have the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.6l4bmc7ovgcn2c9k]{Find Familiar} and @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.z5a26lxyh3esw2rl]{Speak with Animals} spells prepared, and they do not count against your maximum number of spells prepared. You may cast them as rituals normally. Finally, you learn the&nbsp;@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.5o1rvwzxmsh5ji9i]{Druidcraft} cantrip, which does not count against your maximum number of cantrips known.</p>",
