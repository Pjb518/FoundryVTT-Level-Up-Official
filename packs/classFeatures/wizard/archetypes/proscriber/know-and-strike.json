All future <em>Knowledge</em> spells you add to your spellbook are added at 25% of the usual cost in both time and materials. Spells of the <em>Knowledge</em> school are always Wizard spells for you, though other wizards cannot learn them from you unless they normally appear on the wizard list.</p><p>You also gain an exertion pool with 3 points of exertion in it, or, if you already have an exertion pool, it increases by 3 points. You learn the <em>Purge Magic</em> maneuver. If you already know it, you may choose another 1st-degree maneuver from the <em>Tempered Iron</em> school or from another combat tradition that utilizes or nullifies magic.</p>",
