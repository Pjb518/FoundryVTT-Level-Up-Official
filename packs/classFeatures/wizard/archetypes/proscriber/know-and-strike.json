Choose four spells from the <em>knowledge </em>school of a level you can cast and add them to your spellbook. All future <em>knowledge </em>spells you add to your spellbook are added at 25% of the usual cost in both time and materials. Spells of the <em>knowledge </em>school are always wizard spells for you, though other wizards cannot learn them from you unless they normally appear on the wizard list.</p>\n<p>You also gain an exertion pool with 3 points of exertion in it, or, if you already have an exertion pool, it increases by 3 points. You learn the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-maneuvers.Item.e2k7hxnsl3sdrldt]{Purge Magic} maneuver. If you already know it, you may choose another 1st-degree maneuver from the Tempered Iron school or from another combat tradition that utilizes or nullifies magic.</p>",
