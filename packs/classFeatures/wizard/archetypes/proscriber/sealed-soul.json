Any effects that would normally do one of these things simply fail. When you die, your soul goes directly and immediately to its final judgment, preventing @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.6ia3gup3j0m6oigb]{Speak with Dead} from functioning on your corpse. If you are returned to life with the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.3bqdjnpytxlpgcc4]{Reincarnate} spell, you return as the same individual you were before the spell was cast, down to scars, tattoos, and other distinguishing marks.</p>",
