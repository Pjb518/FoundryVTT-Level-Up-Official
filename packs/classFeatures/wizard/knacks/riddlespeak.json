In addition, you can easily avoid speaking directly by cloaking your meaning in wordplay and allusions, allowing you to hide a short message within other speech or writing. Most creatures will take your words at face value, but suspicious creatures may make an Intelligence (Insight) check against your spell save DC to notice that you have hidden a message in your words. On a success of 5 or more, they also learn your hidden meaning. When you use this ability, you may include specific tells and points of reference in your riddlespeak to allow creatures you choose and with whom you are familiar to automatically succeed on the check.</span></p>",
