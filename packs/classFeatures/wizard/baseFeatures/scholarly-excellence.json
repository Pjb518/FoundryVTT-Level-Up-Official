Choose one of the following: </p><h3><strong>Academic </strong></h3><p>You’ve got a whole lot of book smarts. You gain 4 specialties from Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History, Nature, and Religion. Unlike normal, academic specialties may be taken twice (increasing the specialty’s expertise die to 1d6). </p><p>In addition, when you use either Deception or Persuasion to make a point related to an academic specialty, you gain your expertise die from the specialty and use Intelligence for your ability check. </p><h3><strong>Ritual Efficiency </strong></h3><p>When you cast a spell as a ritual, you only add 1 minute to the casting time (instead of 10 minutes). </p><h3><strong>Rote Memorization </strong></h3><p>Choose one cantrip which has a casting time of 1 action and doesn’t deal damage. You can cast that cantrip as a bonus action without any seen or material components a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses of this feature when you finish a long rest, and can switch the cantrip associated with this feature each time you gain a wizard level.</p>",
