If there are active magical effects near you, such as a spell effect on an object or a spell effect in an area, you automatically sense its presence. You don&rsquo;t know what spell effects there are or where they are, but you can automatically sense the effect of magic in a 20-foot radius around you.</p><p>In addition, you have honed your detection spells. Add @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.kaye34nheyrit487]{Detect Magic}<strong> </strong>and&nbsp;@UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.4rgo85d49qwancup]{Detect Thoughts} to your spellbook if they weren&rsquo;t already there. Whenever you cast detect magic, the range that you can sense magic is increased to 60 feet. Whenever you cast detect thoughts, the range of creatures that you can read thoughts from is increased to 60 feet.</p>",
