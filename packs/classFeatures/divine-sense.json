		"description": "<p>Choose one of the following sets of enemies: celestials and fiends, fey and elementals, or aberrations and undead. You can always sense when a creature of one of your chosen types is within 30 feet of you, but cannot determine their number, type, or location. As a bonus action, you can briefly enhance your senses to learn the location, number, and type of any creatures of your chosen types within 30 feet of you. When you do so, creatures of those types that are within range make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, with advantage if the creature's CR is higher than your herald level. On a failed save, you also learn the creature's identity. Within the same radius, you also detect any locations that have been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.</p><p>You can activate this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and regain spent uses upon finishing a long rest. Upon finishing a long rest, you may also swap your chosen set of creature types for another.</p>",
