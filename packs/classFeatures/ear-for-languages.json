    "description": "<p>At 2nd level you train your mind to pick up languages as needed. By spending a short or long rest in the presence of a speaker of any language, you can acquire a rudimentary understanding of that language, enough to have a basic conversation. Any abilities you have that rely on sharing a common language and require a saving throw can work, but the target has advantage on their save.</p><p>The cognitive effort to decode the unfamiliar tongue means that if you use this ability again, you lose access to any other language you learned through it.</p>",
