You may also use what some would call unusual implements as your spellcasting focus. Choose one implement from the toolkit chosen, such as a kitchen knife, wooden spoon, rolling pin, or other similar object. This item counts as a spellcasting focus for you. If your focus is lost or destroyed, it may be replaced as a ritual that takes 10 minutes and 5 gp of natural materials you would use in your practice (such as dried cooking herbs and wood from a cooking fire).</p>",
