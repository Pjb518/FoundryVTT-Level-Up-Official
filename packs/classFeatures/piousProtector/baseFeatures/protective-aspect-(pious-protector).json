		"description": "<p>At 1st level, your dedication to keeping those around you safe manifests. You gain one of the following options:</p><p><br><strong>Mother Hen</strong></p><p>Your concern for your companions leads you to constantly fussing about whether they’re staying well-fed and hydrated, if they’re properly dressed for the conditions, and whether they’re getting enough (or, more likely, too much) exercise. This hovering attention probably irritates your companions a bit, but it is not without its benefits. You gain a pool of care dice equal to your proficiency bonus. When you finish a long rest, you can distribute these dice to your companions as you see fit. Whenever a creature with at least one of these dice fails a saving throw, they can spend one or more of the care dice in their possession to see if your fussing made them able to endure after all. They roll a number of d4s equal to the spent care dice and add them to the roll, potentially altering the results.</p><p><strong>Vigilance</strong></p><p>The world is a dangerous place and you are constantly on the lookout for threats. You gain an expertise die on rolls to spot creatures of the Aberration, Fey, Fiend, and Undead types and on your initiative rolls in combat when the opposition includes at least one creature of one of those types.</p>",
