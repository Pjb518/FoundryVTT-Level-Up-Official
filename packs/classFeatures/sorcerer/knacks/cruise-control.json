During this time you still gain the benefits of completing the rest. Living creatures that are required to pull, push, or otherwise propel a vehicle (e.g the oxen for an ox-drawn wagon) are considered to be resting as well.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The vehicle will follow the path you predetermined (e.g. road, waterway, or heading towards a destination) but will not avoid obstacles that you were unaware of prior to taking your rest. For example if you are aware of a large pothole on the road ahead or rocky outcrop in the sea, the vehicle will go around it, but if you are unaware that a bridge further on has been burned down or that a kraken has recently surfaced along your ocean route, the vehicle will make no attempt to change course.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You cannot stop the vehicle, use a vehicle action, or change course without interrupting your rest.</p>",
