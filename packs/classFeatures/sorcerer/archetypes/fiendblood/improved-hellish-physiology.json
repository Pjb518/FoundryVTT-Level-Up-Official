You gain one of the following benefits based on your choice of Hellish Physiology</p>\n<h2>Infernal Wings</h2>\n<p>If you selected Dark Wings for Hellish Physiology, your fly speed increases to 60 feet. When you are flying, as an action you can cause burning embers to fall from your wings to a space below you. These embers deal 1d8 fire damage to any creatures in the space beneath you and ignite any unattended flammable objects or substances.</p>\n<h2>Tenebrous Claws</h2>\n<p>You seem to swallow the light around you, decreasing the ambient light level by 1 step (from bright light to dim light, from dim light to darkness, and from darkness to magical darkness). You can suppress this darkness at will (no action required). Your claws now deal an additional 1d6 points of necrotic damage if you are in darkness or magical darkness.</p>",
