Choose one of the following options:</p>\n<h2>Fiery Wings</h2>\n<p>You sprout a pair of wings (with an appearance chosen by you when you select this option). Your wings grant you a fly speed equal to your walking speed. Creatures grappling you take 1d4 points of fire damage.</p>\n<h2>Claws of Darkness</h2>\n<p>Your finger nails lengthen and sharpen into fearsome talons. You can make unarmed attacks with these claws, which have the finesse and vicious properties, dealing 1d8 slashing damage. With these claws only, you can make two attacks rather than one when you take the Attack action.</p>",
