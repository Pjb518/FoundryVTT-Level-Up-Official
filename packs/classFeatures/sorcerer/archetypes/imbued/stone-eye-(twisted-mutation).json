		"description": "<p>At 6th level your power grows as your altered physiology adapts to the life you&rsquo;ve led up to this point. You may choose one of the following abilities and are not bound by your flesh and bone selection.</p>\n<p><strong>Stone Eye</strong>: You may attempt to petrify a creature of your choosing within 60ft simply by meeting their gaze. As a bonus action on your turn you force the target to make a Constitution save against your spell save DC. On a failed save the target is Restrained or Petrified instead if they rolled a natural 1. At the end of their next turn restrained targets must make a second Constitution save, becoming Petrified on a failure. This petrification lasts for 1 minute and you may use it once per short rest, or expend two sorcery points as a bonus action to recover it.</p>\n<p>In addition, if you possess the baleful gaze bonded power the effect does not end at the start of the creature&rsquo;s next turn. Instead they must make Constitution saves at the beginning of their turn to end the effect, and it lasts a maximum of 3 turns.</p>",
