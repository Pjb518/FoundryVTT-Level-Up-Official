The casting of the spell is suspended part-way through, and you gain temporary hit points equal to double the spell’s level. When the last of these hit points are lost, the casting of the spell completes (requiring no further action). It is at this point you determine the targets of the spell, if any. Unless it is impossible, the spell must include either you or the source of the triggering damage among its targets or area of effect. You may choose to exclude yourself from a spell with an area, if desired.</p></li></ul>",
