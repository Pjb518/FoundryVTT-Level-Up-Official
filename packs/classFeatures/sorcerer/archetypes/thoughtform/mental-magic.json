When you use this ability, your spell’s verbal and seen components exist only in the mindscape, and are only perceived by psionic creatures or creatures who have been drawn into the mindscape. Any spell cast in this way is treated as having the @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.5m4m8c59etfbilq9]{Subtle} metamagic applied to it, no other metamagic features may alter it further.</p><p>Creatures capable of perceiving your spellcasting in the mindscape may try to interrupt or otherwise interact with it, normally.</p>",
