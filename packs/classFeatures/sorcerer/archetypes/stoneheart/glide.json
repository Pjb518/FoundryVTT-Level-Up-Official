You can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth, and when you burrow in this way, you leave no tunnel behind you. If you&rsquo;re burrowing through stone and you end your movement inside the stone, you take bludgeoning damage equal to your level as it attempts to crush you.</p><p>Additionally, stone in all its forms is no longer a hindrance to you. You ignore&nbsp;difficult terrain caused by molten rock, can walk on it as though it were solid, and take no damage from it unless submerged. Finally, your spells that manipulate stone can now be used on worked stone.</p>",
