Once each round when you use @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.ulmcmf3ofmpzmgzf]{Eldritch Blast}, you can expend 1 mana point to alter its structure as a free action. Choose one of the following:</p><ul><li>You can push more power into the ability, increasing your eldritch blast&rsquo;s damage by one die.</li><li>You can alter the probability around the target. In addition to taking damage from the eldritch blast, it has disadvantage on its next roll.</li></ul><p>If the attack is unsuccessful, the mana is lost. Expending mana does not allow you to absorb any additional mana points. These effects stack with any Eldritch Invocations you can use (though the damage is added and not multiplied in the case of abilities like @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.06hw3ebdcpq2fzgi]{Eldritch Squall}).</p>",
