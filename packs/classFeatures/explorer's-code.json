During the light activity portion of a&nbsp;<span class=\"freelinking-link\">long rest</span>, you can teach this code to any friendly creature with which you share a language. It takes twice as long to convey a message this way. Observers might be able to detect that you&rsquo;re speaking in code, but only creatures who&rsquo;ve been taught the explorer&rsquo;s code understand it.</p>",
