You can do so again when you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3><strong>Awe and Wonder</strong></h3><p>Choose one creature affected by the spell. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the end of its next turn. While charmed in this way, it is incapacitated, has a movement speed of 0, and does nothing but stare blankly at the dazzling effects of your magic. If it takes any damage or is forced to make another saving throw, the charm effect ends.</p><h3></h3>",
