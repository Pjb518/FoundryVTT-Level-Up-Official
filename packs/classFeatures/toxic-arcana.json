		"description": "<p>Beginning at 2nd level when you take this archetype, you learn to safely harvest and handle toxins. You gain proficiency with the poisoner’s kit and on a failed check, you are not poisoned, though you still do not collect any poison. You also have some low-level, permanent wards against poisonous effects. You have advantage on saving throws against spells and effects that would deal poison or necrotic damage to you.</p><p>Finally, spells on the Poison list always count as wizard spells for you, and you may copy a spell on the Poison list into your spellbook at the normal cost for a spell of that level, though other wizards cannot also copy them from your spellbook unless it is normally on the wizard spell list.</p>",
