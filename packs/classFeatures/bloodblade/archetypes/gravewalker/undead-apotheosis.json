		"description": "<p>At 18th level, you gain the following abilities:</p>\n<h2>Ethereal Spectre</h2>\n<p>When you use your @UUID[Compendium.a5e-bloody-heretics.bloody-heretics.Item.mMkPkhSNCe48DP0G]{Ghostly Aspect} ability, you may remain in the Ethereal Plane until you choose to exit it.</p>\n<h2>Raise the Dead</h2>\n<p>You are able to transfer some of your unlife to those felled by your blade. When you reduce an enemy creature whose CR is equal to half of your bloodblade level or less, you may reach out and touch the creature as a bonus action, bringing it back to some form of life. The creature gains the undead creature type and returns to life with half of its hit points. It acts on your initiative and understands basic commands such as &ldquo;Attack&rdquo; or &ldquo;Defend.&rdquo; If no command is issued to the undead creature, it attacks the nearest enemy. Creatures raised in this fashion cannot be healed.</p>\n<p>Once a raised creature is reduced to 0 hit points again, it dissolves into grave dust and cannot be raised again except by a @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.pe52jryde7ljobzq]{Wish} spell. Any reanimated creatures that remain under your control crumble away as if they had been reduced to 0 hit points when you begin a long rest. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier per long rest.</p>\n<h2>Undead Nature</h2>\n<p>You no longer require air, sustenance, or sleep.</p>",
