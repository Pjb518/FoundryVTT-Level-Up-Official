The damage dealt by your @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.t4fBlBaiSejL8KVX]{Sanguine Transference} is acid.</p><p>Any bloodblade features that refer to your type refer to oozes.</p><p>Additionally, choose 1 of the following features:</p><h2>Oxidizing Expectorant</h2><p>You can make a ranged attack by spitting your corrosive saliva (which you are considered to be proficient in) against a foe or object within 30ft. On a hit, your target takes 2d6 + your bloodblade level + your Intelligence modifier points of acid damage. At the start of the target’s turn, they suffer ongoing acid damage equal to your proficiency bonus; this ongoing damage can be stopped by any creature using an Action to wipe off the glob of saliva. This damage is doubled against constructs or metal objects. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.</p><h2>Noxious Fumes</h2><p>As a Bonus Action you off-gas toxic fumes that choke the breath out of your foes. Choose a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus that you can see within 10ft of you. Those creatures make a Constitution saving throw against your maneuver DC or become Poisoned until the start of your next turn. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest. Creatures who do not need to breathe are immune to this effect.</p>",
