The damage dealt by your @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.t4fBlBaiSejL8KVX]{Sanguine Transference} is poison damage.</p><p>Any bloodblade features that refer to your type refer to oozes.</p><p>The poisons that help keep you alive are a potent weapon against the healthy. You gain proficiency in the Viper’s Fangs combat tradition.</p><p>Additionally, choose 1 of the following features:</p><h2>Progressive Decay</h2><p>The poisons, enzymes, and phages your body produces are a force of nature. Your Attacks ignore a creature’s resistance to poison damage and your Attacks treat a creature’s immunity to poison as if it was only resistance to poison damage.</p><p>At level 10, if you hit a creature without any immunity or resistance to poison damage with your Sanguine Transference, any poison damage from any source that creature takes until the end of your next turn is treated as though the creature is vulnerable to poison damage.</p><h2>Infectious Ataxia</h2><p>While you have become used to your limbs occasionally giving up on you, you know that your opponents probably do not have that practice.</p><p>As an attack action (it can replace 1 attack when you gain Extra Attack): choose a number of creatures up to your proficiency bonus that you can see within 30ft. Those creatures make Constitution save versus your maneuver DC or fall prone. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.</p><p>At level 6, when you deal poison damage to an enemy, your maneuver DC when using this ability increases by 1. At level 14, your maneuver DC for this ability increases by a total of 2. Once an enemy fails against this ability, you must deal poison damage again to increase your maneuver DC this way.</p><p></p>",
