The damage dealt by your @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.t4fBlBaiSejL8KVX]{Sanguine Transference} is psychic damage.</p><p>Additionally, choose one of the following:</p><h2>Caustic Spray</h2><p>When you are hit with a melee weapon attack or take damage from a spell, you may immediately use your reaction to fling caustic blood at your attacker in a 10-foot cone. The triggering creature makes a Dexterity saving throw versus your maneuver DC, taking 1d8 + half your bloodblade level (rounded down) acid damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.</p><h2>Maddening Whispers</h2><p>As an action, you may share these whispers with a foe, potentially to their detriment. Choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw versus your maneuver DC or become confused until the end of your next turn. Creatures with the aberration creature type have advantage on this saving throw. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.</p>",
