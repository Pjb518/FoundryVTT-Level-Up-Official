This disruption of the humors can either throw an enemy off-balance, or give you an edge in battle. Choose one of the following features. You gain the second feature when you reach 13th level in this class. You may use your Dyscrasia ability once per short or long rest.</p>\n<h2>Humeric Malediction</h2>\n<p>You reach out and attempt to disrupt the humors of an enemy creature within reach. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a success, nothing happens, and that creature becomes immune to your Dyscrasia ability for the next 24 hours. On a failure, choose one ability score. That creature has disadvantage on ability checks that use the chosen ability score for the next minute.</p>\n<p>You may use your Humeric Malediction feature as a free action if you are frenzied.</p>\n<h2>Humeric Rebalance</h2>\n<p>You reach within and disrupt your own humors, temporarily adjusting yourself to conquer the task at hand. As a bonus action, choose one ability score. You gain a +2 bonus to that ability score (though you cannot take that ability score above 20 using this ability unless you are under the effects of a magic item that allows you to do so) for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier. However, you must also choose another ability score to take a &nbsp;&ndash;2 penalty to in exchange that lasts for the duration.</p>\n<p>You may use your Humeric Rebalance feature as a free action if you are frenzied.</p>",
