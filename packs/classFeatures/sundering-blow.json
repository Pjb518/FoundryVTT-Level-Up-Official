When you score a critical hit, you may choose to either impose the broken property on your target’s armor or shield (if present) until it is repaired or you reduce the armor class of your target by -2 for one hour if it does not have armor or a shield. A given creature can only be affected by one instance of the -2 armor class reduction at a time.</p>",
