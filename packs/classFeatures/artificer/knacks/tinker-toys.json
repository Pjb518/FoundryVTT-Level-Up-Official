		"description": "<p>Your mastery of locomotion and gearing allows you to easily infuse elements of motion into simple devices. As an action you can create and place a Tiny moving gadget called a tinker toy (such as a walking doll, flying whirligig, or toy boat) out of 1 gold worth of materials. This tinker toy has AC 10, 1 hit point, and your choice of a Speed of 10 feet, fly speed of 10 feet, or swim speed of 10 feet. When you place this device it begins moving in a straight line until it is destroyed, it is blocked by an obstacle, or you use a bonus action to pick it up again. Tinker toys made in this way weigh 2 pounds, and can carry up to 1 pound worth of other devices or materials. Once you create a tinker toy in this way you cannot do so again until you finish a short rest, and any existing tinker toys you&rsquo;ve created fall apart whenever you create a new one.</p>",
