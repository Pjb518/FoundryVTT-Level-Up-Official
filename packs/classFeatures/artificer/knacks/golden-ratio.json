When you select this field discovery you may select two 1st-level spells from the druid spell list. These are considered artificer spells for you and you may add them to the list of spells you can prepare. If you are at least a 7th level artificer when you select this field discovery, you may select 1st- or 2nd-level spells from the druid spell list instead. You may select this field discovery multiple times, choosing different druid spells each time.</p>",
