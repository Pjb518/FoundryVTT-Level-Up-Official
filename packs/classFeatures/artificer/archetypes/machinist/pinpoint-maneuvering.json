While driving a vehicle, whenever an action would allow you to change the vehicle’s facing up to 90 degrees, you may change it up to 180 degrees instead.</p><p>In addition, whenever an attack hits a vehicle you’re driving or a collision occurs involving a vehicle you are driving, you can use your reaction to avoid the worst of it, reducing the damage your vehicle would take by the result of a vehicle check (air, land, or water as appropriate to the vehicle).</p>",
