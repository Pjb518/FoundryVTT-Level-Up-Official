Choose two of the following upgrades:</p><h3>Clockwork Speed</h3><p>Your awakened toy’s walking speed increases by 15 feet and it may dash as a bonus action.</p><h3>Durable Armor</h3><p>Your awakened toy’s AC increases by +2.</p><h3>Electrified Bite</h3><p>When your awakened toy would hit with a melee weapon attack, it may add 2d6 lightning damage to the damage roll. If the target creature is made of metal or is wearing metal armor, the awakened toy’s attack roll is made with advantage.</p><h3>Hidden Toolkit</h3><p>You may install one of the following toolkits into your awakened toy, and it may use it at your verbal or telepathic command: herbalism kit, thieves’ tools, poisoner’s kit. Your awakened toy adds your ability score modifier and your proficiency bonus (if applicable) to the check.</p><h3>Improved Telepathy</h3><p>You may now use your awakened toy as a method to communicate with another. So long as you are using your toy’s eyes and ears to see and hear, you may telepathically communicate with one creature that your toy can see.</p><h3>Motion Sensor</h3><p>Your awakened toy has advantage on ability checks made to detect invisible creatures or objects. It alerts you telepathically to any perceived threats.</p>",
