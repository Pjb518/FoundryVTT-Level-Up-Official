Choose one of the following options or one of the upgraded options from level 5:</p>\n<h2>Advanced Armor</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Upgraded Armor</em></p>\n<p>You continue to upgrade your armor, which gains an option based on its type:</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Light Armor: </strong>The armor&rsquo;s stealth system improves. As a bonus action, you can become invisible until the beginning of your next turn. Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum once) you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Medium Armor: </strong>The armor now includes a helmet with a protective breathing mask. You have advantage on saves against inhaled poisons and toxins and may hold your breath for an additional minute before you begin suffocating.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Heavy Armor: </strong>The armor includes a set of strength enhancers. When calculating what you can push, drag, or lift, your size is considered one step larger. This stacks with the Orc heritage&rsquo;s Heavy Lifter feature and similar features.</p>\n<h2>Advanced Weapon</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Upgraded Weapon</em></p>\n<p>If your weapon does not have the Upgraded option for its type, it gains that now. If it does have that option, it instead gains the following one:</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Weapon: </strong>Your weapon gains the Vicious property.</p>\n<h2>Advanced Automaton</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Upgraded Automaton</em></p>\n<p>You further upgrade your automaton. Its AC increases to 15, its hit points increase to 50, and you add one of the following options:</p>\n<p><strong>Antitoxin Module: </strong>The automaton gains three charges which stack with the ones from Autonomous Medic (if applicable). It can spend a charge to neutralize one poison with a DC of 15 or lower in a creature it can touch. It regains all spent charges when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p><strong>Targeting Module: </strong>On its turn as an action, the automaton can highlight a target within 30 feet, granting an expertise die to creatures targeting it with attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Flight Module: </strong>The automaton gains a fly speed of 40 feet.</p>",
