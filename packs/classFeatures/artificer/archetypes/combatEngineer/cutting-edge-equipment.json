Choose one of the following options or one of the options from levels 5 or 9&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cutting-Edge Armor</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Advanced Armor</em></p>\n<p>Your armor&rsquo;s AC increases by 1, and you gain an additional feature based on its type:</p>\n<p><strong>Cutting-Edge Light Armor: </strong>You gain a Climb speed equal to your walking speed and you are permanently under a spider climb effect while you are wearing it.</p>\n<p><strong>Cutting-Edge Medium Armor: </strong>Your armor now includes various measures to prevent you from succumbing to the worst that supernatural foes can dish out. You gain immunity to the petrified condition and make saving throws to avoid the confused, frightened, incapacitated, paralyzed, and slowed conditions with advantage.</p>\n<p><strong>Cutting-Edge Heavy Armor: </strong>Your armor now protects your allies as well as you and has anti- magic countermeasures incorporated. Friendly creatures your size or smaller can use you to provide 3/4th cover. Your armor is also immune to magical spells and effects that target it specifically such as the heat metal spell or a rust monster&rsquo;s antennae.</p>\n<h2>Cutting-Edge Weapon</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Advanced Weapon</em></p>\n<p>Choose two first-level combat maneuvers that cost no more than 1 exertion. While wielding your weapon, you can use these maneuvers at will without spending exertion.</p>\n<h2>Cutting-Edge Automaton</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite: </strong><em>Advanced Automaton</em></p>\n<p>Your automaton&rsquo;s speed increases by 20 feet, its AC increases to 17, its hit points increase to 70, and you add one of the following options:</p>\n<p><strong>Stabilizer Ray:</strong> The automaton gains 3 charges which stack with the ones from Autonomous Medic and Antitoxin Module (if applicable). As an action on its turn, the automaton can spend a charge to automatically stabilize a creature making death saves within 30 feet of it. It regains all spent charges when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p><strong>Tinkerer&rsquo;s Arms:</strong> The automaton gains a set of built-in thieves&rsquo; tools and can use them with a bonus equal to your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier at your direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Teleportation Module:</strong> As a bonus action on your turn, you can teleport to an empty space adjacent to your automaton. Once you have used this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum once) you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
