		"description": "<p>Finally, at level 3, you put together a set of equipment that will aid you in combat. You gain all of the following:</p>\n<h2>Custom Armor</h2>\n<p>Choose one of the following options:</p>\n<p><strong>Light Armor: </strong>Your armor provides you an AC of 12 + your Dexterity modifier. It is designed for stealth and mobility, giving you an expertise die on Acrobatics, Athletics, and Stealth checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Medium Armor: </strong>Your armor provides you an AC of 14 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum 2). It is designed for versatility, and allows you to draw or stow any one-handed weapon or spell focus you have on your person without using an action once per turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Heavy Armor: </strong>Your armor provides you an AC of 17. It is designed for maximum protection and also provides you with temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus which regenerate at the beginning of each of your turns.</p>\n<h2>Custom Melee Weapon</h2>\n<p>Choose one of the following options:</p>\n<p><strong>Quick Weapon:</strong> Select a weapon with the finesse and/or dual-wielding properties. It gains both of these properties and the parrying property if it does not already have them.</p>\n<p><strong>Versatile Weapon:</strong> Select a weapon with the Versatile property. It gains the Defensive (any) property.</p>\n<p><strong>Heavy Weapon:</strong> Select a weapon with the two- handed property. It gains the parrying immunity property and deals an additional 1d4 points of damage.</p>\n<h2>Custom Automaton</h2>\n<p>You have an automaton that obeys your commands as if it were a familiar per the find familiar spell. It has the stats of a Gear Spider with the addition of one of the following options:</p>\n<p><strong>Autonomous Medic:</strong> Your automaton can help you and your companions stay alive in combat. When you finish a short or long rest, it gains a number of healing charges equal to your proficiency bonus. As a bonus action, you can have the assistant move up to its movement speed and heal a creature it can touch for hit points equal to 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Autonomous Weapon:</strong> Your automaton is equipped with a ranged weapon with a range of 100/400 that deals piercing damage equal to 1d12 + your Intelligence modifier. On your turn, you can use your action to direct it to fire on a target you can see, using an attack bonus of your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Autonomous Scanner: </strong>You can use a bonus action to have your automaton take the Search action on your behalf.</p>\n<p>If you lose your weapon, armor, or automaton or it is destroyed, you may replace one of them at the end of a long rest. You can only replace one item per rest and any previous version (including one no longer in your possession) crumbles to worthless scrap when you do; the new version has the same traits as the old one, including any upgrades you have applied. You may also use this ability to construct a new item of the same variety with different options.</p>",
