If you do so, all attack rolls against you have advantage for the same duration. Also while bloodied your chance to critically hit with weapon attacks is 19-20. If you already critically hit on better than a natural 20 you instead increase your critical hit range by 1 to a maximum of 17-20.</p>\n<p>In addition, if you die all allies within 60 feet that see you fall gain inspiration.</p>",
