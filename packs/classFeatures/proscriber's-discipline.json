At this stage you are a neophyte and are often under the tutelage of a more experienced Proscriber, though in times of crisis, even very inexperienced Proscribers may be sent out to do what they can against the darkness.</p></blockquote><p>You gain proficiency with the <em>Arcana</em> and <em>Religion</em> skills, or gain an expertise die if you are already proficient. You also gain the <em>Aberrations</em> skill specialty for Arcana and the <em>Fiends</em> skill specialty for religion. You may select another skill specialty for a relevant skill if you already possess one of these skill specialties.</p><p>In addition, you learn one of the most important and dangerous techniques of the Proscriber order. If you are affected by the <em>charmed</em>, <em>confused</em>, <em>frightened</em>, <em>incapacitated</em>, <em>paralyzed</em>, <em>petrified</em>, or <em>stunned</em> conditions, you may choose to spend a hit die and gain a level of strife (no action required). The condition ends immediately.</p>",
