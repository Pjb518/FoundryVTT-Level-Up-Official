By spending 8 hours sparring, you can teach another willing creature a maneuver you have mastered using Maneuver Specialization. A creature must be proficient in at least one combat tradition to learn a maneuver in this way, it can only learn maneuvers of a degree from which it already knows at least one maneuver, this counts against its numbers of maneuvers known.</p>",
