You can&rsquo;t take a particular Fighting Style more than once.</p><h3>Archery</h3><p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls with ranged weapons.</p><h3>Battle Ready</h3><p>You can activate up to two combat stances you know without expending any exertion points using the same bonus action. Once you activate a set of combat stances in this way, you can&rsquo;t use this feature again until you finish a rest.</p><h3>Defense</h3><p>You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing armor.</p><h3>Dueling</h3><p>You deal an extra 2 damage with melee weapons held in one hand while you aren&rsquo;t wielding another weapon.</p><h3>Great Weapon Fighting</h3><p>When you hit with a versatile or two-handed weapon you are wielding in two hands, you can reroll any 1 or 2 on a damage die. You must use the new roll, even if it is a 1 or 2.</p><h3>Mounted Combatant</h3><p>While mounted, you gain an expertise die on attack rolls against creatures that are Medium or smaller and not mounted. In addition, you gain an expertise die on saving throws made to resist being dismounted.</p><h3>Protection</h3><p>When a creature you can see attacks another target within 5 feet of you, if you are wielding a shield you can use your reaction to hinder the attack, forcing the creature to roll with disadvantage.</p><h3>Technical Fighting</h3><p>Whenever you use a combat maneuver, any damage dealt by attacks using it deals an additional 2 damage, and your maneuver DC increases by 1.</p><h3>Thrown Weapon Fighting</h3><p>Whenever you would make an attack using a weapon with the Thrown property, you can draw the weapon as part of the attack. In addition, your ranged weapon attacks with thrown weapons deal an additional 2 damage.</p><h3>Tireless Fighting</h3><p>Whenever you expend Hit Dice to recover exertion points, you recover 3 exertion points per Hit Die expended (instead of 1d4 exertion points as normal).</p><h3>Two-Weapon Fighting</h3><p>While two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the off-hand attack.</p><h3>Unarmed Fighting</h3><p>Your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. If you aren&rsquo;t wielding any weapons or a shield, you can strike with both of your hands to deal damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier. If you start your turn grappling a creature, you can deal your basic melee damage to any creature you are grappling.</p>",
