You gain the following features.</p><h3 class=\"Indent1\">Master of Combat</h3><p>You master every maneuver you know and any future maneuvers you learn as per Maneuver Specialization. Additionally, choose one maneuver of 3rd degree or less that you know. You are able to use the chosen maneuver without expending any exertion points.</p><h3 class=\"Indent1\">Finishing Blow</h3><p>You can make spectacular, devastating attacks which inspire awe in those nearby. When you miss with a weapon attack while taking the Attack action, you can choose to hit instead. Alternatively, you can choose to change a hit with a weapon attack into a critical hit, or when you score a critical hit you can choose to deal maximum damage.</p><p>All hostile creatures who see your Finishing Blow make a Wisdom&nbsp;saving throw&nbsp;against your maneuver DC or become&nbsp;frightened&nbsp;for 1 minute.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a&nbsp;short or long rest .</p>",
