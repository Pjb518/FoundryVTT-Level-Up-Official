Additionally, choose one maneuver of 3rd degree or less that you know. You are able to use the chosen maneuver without expending any exertion points.</p>\n<h3 class=\"Indent1\">Finishing Blow</h3>\n<p>You can make spectacular, devastating attacks which inspire awe in those nearby. When you miss with a weapon attack while taking the Attack action, you can choose to hit instead. Alternatively, you can choose to change a hit with a weapon attack into a critical hit, or when you score a critical hit you can choose to deal maximum damage.</p>\n<p>All hostile creatures who see your Finishing Blow make a Wisdom&nbsp;<span>saving throw</span>&nbsp;against your maneuver DC or become&nbsp;<span>frightened</span>&nbsp;for 1 minute.</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a&nbsp;<span>short or long rest</span> .</p>",
