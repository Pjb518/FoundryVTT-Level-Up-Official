Choose one of the following options:</p><h3 class=\"Indent1\">Military Traditions</h3><p>You&rsquo;ve familiarized yourself with wars long past and military protocols of the present. You gain an&nbsp;expertise die&nbsp;on Intelligence checks made to recall lore or gather information regarding warfare or military action. In addition, you gain an expertise die on Charisma checks made to influence soldiers, guards, or other organized martial forces.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=\"Indent1\">Size Up</h3><p>Your combat experience against a wide variety of foes has given you a good eye for evaluating threats. You can use a bonus action to determine the CR of a creature you can see within 200 feet, and that creature&rsquo;s maneuver DC.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=\"Indent1\">Weapon Lore</h3><p>You gain an&nbsp;expertise die on Intelligence checks made to recall lore or gather information about weapons, armor, and other martial equipment. In addition, you can use an action to investigate the magical properties of such an item by handling it, such as swinging a sword or hefting a shield. You learn its properties, how to use them, whether it requires attunement, and how many charges it has. You also learn if the item has any sentience or bears a curse, though you only learn if it is sentient or cursed (not the nature of that sentience or curse).&nbsp;</p>",
