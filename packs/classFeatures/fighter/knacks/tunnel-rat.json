While wielding a @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-adventuring-gear.Item.vqseoqiptkqkux3k]{Shovel}, you can dig a 5 foot by 5-foot wide tunnel through nonmagical sand, loose earth, loamy soil, mud, or snow (but not solid rock) at a speed of 5 feet every 15 minutes, which includes the time taken to shore up the tunnel and add support. You can dig pits and trenches open to the air at twice this speed. In addition, you may ignore the effects of roughing it due to environmental conditions while resting in a trench or hole.</p>",
