Choose one of the following:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Loyal to the Crown.</strong></em> You are loyal to a specific nation, lord, organization, or other authority. While you are in good standing with that authority and are within their area of influence, you and your allies can easily find free food and lodging, and creatures with a CR lower than yours that are also loyal to that authority may perform simple tasks at your request. You lose good standing with that authority if you go against their wishes. Consult the Narrator on authorities within the campaign setting, their wishes, and what will keep or return you to good standing with them.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Loyal to the Code.</strong></em> You are loyal to a specific code of honor. You gain an expertise die on Persuasion checks. However, whenever you break your code you suffer a level of strife and instead have disadvantage on Persuasion checks for the following 7 days. Choose one of the following codes to keep:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I will never harm a creature that has surrendered.</li>\n<li>I will never steal from a living soul.</li>\n<li>I will never let a lie pass my lips.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alternatively, consult the Narrator for any codes specific to the campaign setting.</p>",
