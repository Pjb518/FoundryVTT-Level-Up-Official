Depending on which creature type pair you are attuned to, you can sense if you are within a mile of an area of a hazard or hazards associated with those types as indicated below. In order for this feature to work, &ldquo;hazard&rdquo; is defined by qualifying for the encounter element listed; this will not pick up a candle flame, a bottle of vinegar, someone&rsquo;s magnetized compass needle, an icebox, or other innocuous, typically non-hazardous occurrences of these conditions. You also know the general directions (compass points) of any hazards detected.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Celestials and Fiends:</strong> Acid, extreme heat, fire, lava, memory crystals</li>\n<li><strong>Fey and Elementals:</strong> Acid, extreme cold, extreme heat, fire, lava, poisonous plants</li>\n<li><strong>Aberrations and Undead:</strong> High gravity, low gravity, magnetized ore, miring ground, vacuum</li>\n</ul>",
