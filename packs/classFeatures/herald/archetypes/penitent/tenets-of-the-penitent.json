If you can fall, so can others. If you can be better, so can others. Never forget this. Never ignore it.</li>\n<li><strong>Compassion.</strong> You know better than most what can happen when people are at their worst. Strive to create circumstances where they can be at their best instead.</li>\n<li><strong>Wisdom.</strong> Sometimes the cost of saving someone will be too high. Do not sacrifice the lives and safety of innocents in an attempt to sway the truly wicked.</li>\n</ul>",
