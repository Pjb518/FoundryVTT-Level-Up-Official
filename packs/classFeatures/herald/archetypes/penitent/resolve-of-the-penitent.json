You become immune to charm and compulsion effects, and you have advantage on saving throws made to avoid becoming frightened.  You also gain an expertise die on Insight checks and can always use Charisma when making Insight checks.  Finally, while your fatigue or your strife is 4 or less, the penalty you take for it is reduced by one level.</p>",
