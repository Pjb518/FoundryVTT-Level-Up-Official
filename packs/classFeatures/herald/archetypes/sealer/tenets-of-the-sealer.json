Judge others on their actions, not their appearance or lineage.</li>\n<li><strong>Return the Fugitive.</strong> If something that should not roam free escapes its confinement, it is your responsibility to return it to its prison.</li>\n<li><strong>Seal Away. </strong>Guard the prisons of dangerous entities with dedication and care.</li>\n</ul>",
