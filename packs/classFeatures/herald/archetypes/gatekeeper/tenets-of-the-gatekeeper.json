They must be kept separate and apart, and the natural order of the cosmos maintained.</li>\n<li><strong>Unwelcome Spirits. </strong>Beings from distant planes are as dangerous and alien as the realms they hail from. They must never trusted, and extinguished or driven back wherever they are found.</li>\n<li><strong>Trust in What is Real. </strong>The physical world is the only truly real one. Worship the gods if you will, but let the gods stay in their heavens. You live in the world. Do not forget that.</li>\n<li><strong>Exorcism.</strong> Everyone&rsquo;s body and mind belongs to themself. Do not tolerate possessions, and end such corruption wherever it is found. Even a willing possession is an abomination.</li>\n</ul>",
