Your cannot be led astray by the whims of fickle morality, for you serve something greater, a legacy that stretches beyond a single action, moment, or even ruler.</li>\n<li><strong>Heavy is the Head that Wears the Crown.</strong> If you are a ruler you are bound by burdens and responsibilities heavier than any subject could realize. You must bear them dutifully and without complaint, or if sworn to a leader&rsquo;s service do all you can to aid them in their task and lighten their load.</li>\n<li><strong>Your Life Belongs to your People Now.</strong> Do not heedlessly endanger yourself or recklessly throw your life away for it does not belong to you. It belongs to your liege, as theirs belongs to their subjects. Seek not personal glory, but only to glorify those you are beholden to.</li>\n</ul>",
