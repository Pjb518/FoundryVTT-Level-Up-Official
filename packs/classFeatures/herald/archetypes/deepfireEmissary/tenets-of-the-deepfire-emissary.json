Feel your feelings and act upon them responsibly.</li>\n<li><strong>Decisiveness. </strong>Once the proper course of action is clear, every moment of delay is a cowardly waste.</li>\n<li><strong>Creativity.</strong> Every warrior should be able to build or create as well as destroy.</li>\n<li><strong>Ferocity. </strong>Your foes should fear your wrath and your friends should be grateful for your protection.</li>\n</ul>",
