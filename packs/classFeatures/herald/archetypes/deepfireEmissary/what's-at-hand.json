You gain proficiency with two artisanâ€™s tool sets of your choice, and when working with materials you gathered yourself (in other words, not purchased, but that you farmed, gathered, mined, fished, hunted, or harvested personally) no more than 20 miles from your current location, you gain an expertise die on your crating rolls. If the material is volcanic in nature (such as obsidian, pumice, or basalt), the expertise die increases by two steps, to a maximum of a d10.</p>",
