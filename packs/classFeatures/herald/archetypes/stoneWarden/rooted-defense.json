While rooted, your Speed becomes 0, but whenever an effect would move you or knock you&nbsp;prone</span>, you ignore that effect, and the ground within 10 feet of you becomes&nbsp;difficult terrain. In addition, while you are rooted, a creature you hit with a&nbsp;<span>melee weapon attack must make a Strength save against a DC of 10 + your proficiency bonus. On a failure, the creature&rsquo;s Speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. You can end your rooted state as an action.</p>",
