Those you defend must be able to trust in your resilience.</li>\n<li><strong>Stable as Stone.</strong> You must be consistent, dependable, and fair in your dealings. Let no hint of caprice or pique cloud your judgment, but cleave to what is right.</li>\n<li><strong>Strong as Stone.</strong> You must be willing to shoulder far more than your &ldquo;share&rdquo; to walk this path.</li>\n<li><strong>Will of Stone, Not Heart of Stone.</strong> You must be incorruptible, implacable, and uncompromising, but this must be tempered with empathy and compassion. Strength without goodness is worse than weakness.</li>\n</ul>",
