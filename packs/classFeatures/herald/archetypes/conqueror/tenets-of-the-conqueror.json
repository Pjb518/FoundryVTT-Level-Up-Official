Correct them of their mistake.</li>\n<li><strong>Ever Advance. </strong>It is not enough simply to defend what you have. Whether by ancestral right, divine right, or the right of might you seek to press on and expand your holdings, be they land, possessions, or prestige.</li>\n<li><strong>Iron Will, Iron Body.</strong> You must show total conviction in your choices, no matter what doubts you bury within, and maintain the personal strength of arms to back them up. An army is only as strong as its head.</li>\n</ul>",
