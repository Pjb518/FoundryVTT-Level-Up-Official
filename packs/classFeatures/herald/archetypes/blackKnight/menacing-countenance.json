		"description": "<p>At 7th level, you can exude fearsomeness in a way that unsettles even the courageous. As a bonus action, you can choose to exude menace. For the next minute, creatures that are not already friendly to you that see you must make a Wisdom save against your passive spell save DC. Creatures that fail this saving throw are daunted by your fearsome aspect.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A daunted creature acts in various ways depending on the situation and the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion. Most non-hostile daunted creatures simply find somewhere else to be. Hostile daunted creatures might also excuse themselves (often making a show of bravado before doing so). A daunted creature that attacks you takes a -1d4 penalty to their attack rolls.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A creature engaged in combat with you can re-attempt their save against this effect at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. Creatures not in combat with you can retry the save every hour. A creature that successfully saves against this effect gains immunity to it for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>Creatures that are immune to fear are also immune to your Menacing Countenance, as are creatures more than one size larger than you or creatures with a CR higher than half of your herald level. Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
