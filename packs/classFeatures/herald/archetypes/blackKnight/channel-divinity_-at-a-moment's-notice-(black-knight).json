Thereafter, you may use your channel divinity as a bonus action to summon the marked items onto your body. The armor appears on your body and any weapon or shield appears in your hands. If you are wearing different armor or are carrying other items, they appear in a neat pile at your feet. This effect works at any distance, provided your marked items are on the same plane as you.</p>",
