The target of the attack takes an additional 1d8 necrotic damage and must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. If the target fails, it cannot regain hit points until it finishes a long rest. If it succeeds, its maximum hit points are reduced by an amount equal to the damage done by your attack until it finishes a long rest.</p>",
