Strive to embody the principles of your deity, and inspire others to do the same.</p><p>• Life In Service. When your deity calls, you answer, and all you do is in dedication to them.</p><p>• Quick of Mind. Steel yourself against psychic attacks that may sway you from service.</p><p>• Strong of Body. Peak physical condition must be maintained, in order to serve to the best of your abilities.</p><p><strong>Archetype School </strong></p><p>Add the good and radiant schools of magic to your list of herald spells (or if you are an unholy champion, the evil and necrotic schools of magic).</p>",
