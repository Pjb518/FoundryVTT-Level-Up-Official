Choose one of the following options.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Aura of Darkness.</strong></em> After initiative is rolled, when a hostile creature starts its turn in your aura or first enters into it on a turn, it makes a Wisdom saving throw or becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. Once a creature has been frightened by this aura, it is immune to the aura&rsquo;s effects for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Aura of Light.</strong></em> An unconscious ally with 0 hit points that starts its turn in your aura automatically succeeds on one death saving throw each turn. Once a creature has succeeded on three death saving throws while in your aura, it cannot benefit from this effect until it has finished a long rest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
