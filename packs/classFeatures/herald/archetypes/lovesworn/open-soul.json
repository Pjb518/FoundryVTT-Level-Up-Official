You may cast @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.4rgo85d49qwancup]{Detect Thoughts} without a spell slot. However, when you cast this spell in this way, your target is also able to read your surface thoughts on an initial failed save. Likewise, if you choose to probe deeper into the target&rsquo;s mind and the target fails its saving throw, the target is also able to probe deeper into your mind. If you choose, you may allow a willing target to read your surface thoughts or to probe deeper into your mind without (or before) doing so to them.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once a creature succeeds on a saving throw against this ability, it cannot be targeted again for 24 hours unless it is willing.</p>",
