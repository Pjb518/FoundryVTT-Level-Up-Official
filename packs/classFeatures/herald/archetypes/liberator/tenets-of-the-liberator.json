Tear down cruelty and corruption wherever you can find it. Destroy them utterly, and do not allow new oppressors to take their place.</li>\n<li><strong>Pragmatism. </strong>Don&rsquo;t let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Sometimes compromises must be made for the sake of the greater good.</li>\n<li><strong>Equality.</strong> Freedom is for everyone, not just a select group of people. The only exceptions are those who would use their own freedom to deny it to others.</li>\n<li><strong>Justice. </strong>Brutal chaos where the strong dominate the weak is no freedom at all.</li>\n</ul>",
