Choose one of the following options:</p>\n<h2>Order of Justice</h2>\n<p>You receive the authority and funding to set up your own order. You gain a level 5 stronghold of average quality of the castle, temple, or training hall type, and two seasoned followers chosen from the diviner, healer, interpreter, sage, or smith types. At the Narrator&rsquo;s option, you can place this stronghold somewhere unusual or purchase upgrades for it at the normal cost as part of the acquisition process. You also gain the services of two NPCs of up to CR 5.</p>\n<h2>Divine Certainty</h2>\n<p>You can survey the scene of a grave injustice or atrocity and instantly know who is responsible, both for the actual action itself and anyone who ordered it. The responsible parties are immediately marked as per your Render Verdict ability (no save). Nothing short of the wish spell or the intervention of a deity can thwart this feature.</p>",
