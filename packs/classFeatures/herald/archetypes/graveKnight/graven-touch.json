Your Lay on Hands ability can restore hit points to undead creatures (including yourself), but healing is now only half as efficient as it once was; you must spend 2 points to heal a point of damage, and you must spend 7 to cure a disease or neutralize a poison. However, you can now spend 5 points to deal an additional 1d8 points of necrotic damage when hit with a weapon attack. This may not be combined with Divine Smite, and you cannot spend more than 5 points per turn on this feature.</p>",
