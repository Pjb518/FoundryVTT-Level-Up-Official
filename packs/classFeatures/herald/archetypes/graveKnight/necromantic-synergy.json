You gain one of the following abilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unliving swiftness</strong>: If you chose @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.3Jb49f3nacLzry86]{Path of the Vampire}, your speed increases by 10 feet. You may also spend 7 exertion points to cast @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.zhtyft34531a9nil]{Haste} on yourself.</li>\n<li><strong>Binding wrappings</strong>: If you chose @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.orEuSrQOYCY8xHXq]{Path of the Mummy}, you may spend 2 exertion points to extend your wrappings out to snare a creature up to 1 size category larger than yourself you can see within 30 feet. Make a ranged weapon attack as an action. If you hit, the creature is grappled (escape DC equal to your maneuver DC). While the creature remains grappled this way, you may spend a bonus action to drag the creature 10 feet closer to you.</li>\n<li><strong>Grasp of Vengeance</strong>: If you chose @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.Ag1d3VyeU3B3TvBE]{Path of the Revenant}, you can strangle your foes at range with the sheer power of your hate. As an action, you may spend 4 exertion points to make a ranged spell attack against a creature you can see within 30 feet. It must make a Constitution save against your spell save DC or begin suffocating. The target may repeat this save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. The effect also ends if you are knocked unconscious or die or if the target has remove curse or similar magic cast on it. A creature that successfully saves against your Grasp of Vengeance is immune to it for 24 hours.</li>\n</ul>",
