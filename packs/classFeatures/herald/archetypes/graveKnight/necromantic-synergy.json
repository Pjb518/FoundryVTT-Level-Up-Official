You may also spend 7 Exertion points to cast Haste on yourself.</li>\n<li><strong>Binding wrappings</strong>: If you chose Path of the Mummy, you may spend 2 exertion points to extend your wrappings out to snare a creature up to 1 size category larger than yourself you can see within 30 feet. Make a ranged weapon attack as an action. If you hit, the creature is grappled (escape DC equal to your maneuver DC). While the creature remains grappled this way, you may spend a bonus action to drag the creature 10 feet closer to you.</li>\n<li><strong>Grasp of Vengeance</strong>: If you chose Path of the Revenant, you can strangle your foes at range with the sheer power of your hate. As an action, you may spend 4 exertion points to make a ranged spell attack against a creature you can see within 30 feet.
