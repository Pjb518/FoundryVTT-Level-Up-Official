Even gods perish in time. Remember this, but also remember always that death need not be the end.</li>\n<li><strong>Terror.</strong> Few can look into the face of death without fear. The same should be true for you.</li>\n<li><strong>Endurance.</strong> Victory belongs to those who can persevere, even past the veil of mortality if need be.</li>\n</ul>",
