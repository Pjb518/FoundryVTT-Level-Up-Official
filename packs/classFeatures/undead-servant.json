Choose the corpse or pile of bones of a humanoid or beast creature with a CR of 1/4 or less, which has a size of medium or smaller. The creature gains the zombie or skeleton template, as appropriate.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If the creature you reanimate has spell slots, it does not regain any used spell slots upon being reanimated, nor upon completing a short or long rest.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The undead has its own turn, rolling its own initiative, and acts on its own turn. The undead won&rsquo;t attack except as a reaction to being attacked, but it can take other actions as normal. In addition, whenever the undead rolls initiative, it gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your wizard level multiplied but your proficiency bonus.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As a bonus action on your turn, you can order the undead to take an action on its turn. If you order the undead to attack, it adds your proficiency bonus to attack rolls.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
