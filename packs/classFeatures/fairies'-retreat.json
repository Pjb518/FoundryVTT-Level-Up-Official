You can use an action to teleport yourself and up to five willing creatures you can see within 30 feet, disappearing in flashes of bright color or a vortex of leaves. You each reappear no further than 1 mile away, in the nearest unoccupied space within 30 feet of your Toadstool Sanctuary, or a fairy ring or monolith consecrated to the fey which you have previously seen. If you are already at such a location when you use this feature, you and the creatures instead teleport into or return from the Dreaming.</p><p>Once you have used this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
