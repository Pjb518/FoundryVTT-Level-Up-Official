You must make a DC 15 check with a skill of the Narrator's choosing to see if these preparations were successful. Examples include: I found this ancient map previously and am only now revealing it, I just happened to have this exact medicine on my person, or I anticipated the king might arrest us and so bribed a guard to leave a key under this loose brick. Such a benefit cannot grant a magic item, and any equipment or item it grants should cost less than 100 x your proficiency bonus in gold. Once you have successfully used this ability, you cannot do so again until you have leveled up.</p>",
