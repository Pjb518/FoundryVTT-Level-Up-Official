You gain proficiency with the Deception and Sleight of Hand skills. You may rely on legerdemain, saving the real magic for when it’s truly needed, or you may just have an ability to surreptitiously take small items like scrolls and wands without notice. Or both. You may always choose to use Intelligence when making Deception checks.</p><p>You’re also able to work much faster when copying spells to your spellbook. The time to copy a new spell is halved</p>",
