This die changes as you gain adept levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Adept table.</p></li><li><p>When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or an adept weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.</p></li></ul>",
