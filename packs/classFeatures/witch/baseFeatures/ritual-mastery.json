		"description": "<p>Witches have an unparalleled mastery of ritual magic. A 9th level, you can cast any witch spell with the ritual tag, even if you do not have it prepared. In addition, at 9th level, and again at 18th level you may choose one of the following abilities:</p><h3>Book of Dreams</h3><p>You may select one ritual spell on your spell list and add it to a dream journal. Once per long rest while sleeping or trancing, you may ritually cast one of the spells in your journal. Each time you gain a witch level, you may add another ritual spell you know to the list. In addition, you always have the dream spell prepared, it does not count against the number of prepared spells, and you may ritually cast it even though it does not have the ritual tag, but only while you are sleeping or trancing.</p><h3>Coven Casting</h3><p>You may link two other creatures while ritual casting. When the three of you work together tto ritually cast a spell that any of you are capable of ritually casting, you may upcast the spell to the highest level available to you. All three participants must be involved for the entire casting as if tthey were individually performing the ritual, and it takes the full casting time + 10 minutes, unless all participants have an ability that reduces ritual casting time.</p><h3>Ritual Attire</h3><p>Choose one of the following types of attire: wearing clothing entirely of a single colour (clothes that are stained, muddied, bloodied, or otherwise dirty in ways that break this single colour scheme prevent this ability from functioning, as does weaing anything of a different colour), multiple pieces of jewelry made of a specific material and containing specific designs (total value worth at least 1000 gold and must be custom made), or being skyclad.</p><p>When wearing this specific attire, ritually casting a spell only increases the cast time by 1 minute, and you may ritually cast two spells you have access to at once, provided they have the same casting time. This benefit only applies to spells that you ritually cast on your own.</p><h3>Candle Magic</h3><p>You may spend an amount of time equal to 1 hour + the casting time of any ritual spell you know to create a candle imbued with its power. Whenever any creature lights this candle, they gain benefits as if they had ritually cast the spell.</p><p>A candle will burn for the duration of the spell contained within, and while burning cannot be put out by non-magical means. The creature that lit the candle can choose to extinguish it to end the spell early. Doing so saves any unused duration to be used later, though the duration must be spent in 1 minute increments.</p><p>A witch may maintain a number of candles created in this fashion equal to their proficiency bonus, and if they attempt to craft another one while at this limit, the oldest one they made loses its magic. They must also have access to the materials necessary for candle making to do so, though the cost involved in doing so is negligible.</p>",
