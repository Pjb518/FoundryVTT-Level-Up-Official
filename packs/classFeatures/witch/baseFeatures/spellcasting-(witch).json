    "description": "<p>In tune with the very essence of magic itself, you are capable of performing great wonders. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the witch spell list.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the witch spell list. You learn additional witch cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Witch table.</p><h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3><p>The Witch table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your witch spells. To cast one of these witch spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of witch spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the witch spell list. When you do so, choose a number of witch spells equal to your spellcasting modifier + your witch level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>Casting spells doesn&rsquo;t remove them from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells whenever you finish a long rest by meditating for at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. You can only do so if your familiar is present.</p><h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3><p>Choose Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma to be your spellcasting ability for your witch spells. Once you make this choice, you cannot change it. You use your chosen ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your chosen ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a witch spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your chosen ability modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your chosen ability modifier</p><h3>Ritual Casting</h3><p>You can cast a witch spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p><h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3><p>You can use of any arcane, divine, or nature focus as a spellcasting focus for your witch spells.</p>",
