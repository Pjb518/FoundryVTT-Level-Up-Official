Whenever any creature lights this candle, they gain benefits as if they had ritually cast the spell.</p><p>A candle will burn for the duration of the spell contained within, and while burning cannot be put out by non-magical means. The creature that lit the candle can choose to extinguish it to end the spell early. Doing so saves any unused duration to be used later, though the duration must be spent in 1 minute increments.</p><p>A witch may maintain a number of candles created in this fashion equal to their proficiency bonus, and if they attempt to craft another one while at this limit, the oldest one they made loses its magic. They must also have access to the materials necessary for candle making to do so, though the cost involved in doing so is negligible.</p>",
