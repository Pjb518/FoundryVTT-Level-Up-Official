Once per long rest while sleeping or trancing, you may ritually cast one of the spells in your journal. Each time you gain a witch level, you may add another ritual spell you know to the list. In addition, you always have the dream spell prepared, it does not count against the number of prepared spells, and you may ritually cast it even though it does not have the ritual tag, but only while you are sleeping or trancing.</p>",
