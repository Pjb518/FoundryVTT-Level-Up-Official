The spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.</p><p>Being raised from the dead takes a toll on the body, mind, and spirit. The target takes a -4 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks.</p><p>At the conclusion of each long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until the target completely recovers.</p><p>Resurrecting a creature that has been dead for one year or longer is exhausting. Until you finish a long rest, you can't cast spells again and you have disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.</p>",

In addition, if a creature has been dead for less than a year, you may cast this spell to raise them without requiring a material component. Once you have raised a particular creature this way, you may not raise that same creature in this way again, and doing so is exhausting, inflicting penalties as if the target has been dead for over 1 year.</p>",
