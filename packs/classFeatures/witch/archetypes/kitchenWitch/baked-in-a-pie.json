You may cast a witch spell that would target a creature into a food item or a beverage, and any creature who consumes that item experiences the effects of the spell as if it had been cast on them (consuming the food requires an action). If a spell would require concentration, the creature who consumed the item rolls any checks to maintain concentration, but they use your spellcasting save DC and spellcasting ability modifier to calculate spell attacks and damage rolls. You may only create one of these foodstuffs at a time, and if you create another item in this fashion the effects of the first spell immediately end.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, if you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you may create a @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-adventuring-gear.Item.db6h8nfiv8kgfpo5]{Blackbird Pie}, as in the wondrous item. Once you conjure forth a blackbird pie in this fashion, you may not do so again until you complete a long rest.</p>",
