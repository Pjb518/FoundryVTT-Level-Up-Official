You can spend 3 sorcery points before eating a pound of just about anything organic — bark, grass, cactus flesh, bone, whatever’s at hand—and so long as you can stomach the taste, it counts as 1 Supply for you as your body transmutes it into something more edible. A poisonous substance consumed in this way is still poisonous.</p>",
