In addition to dispelling any magical darkness within 30 feet, enemy creatures within 30 feet make a Constitution saving throw or are blinded by the light for 1 minute. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p>Alternatively, you can choose to make the light more harmful. On a failed saving throw a creature takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level, or half damage on a success. </p>",
