In addition, you may use your spellcasting ability modifier in place of your Strength modifier when determining the distance and height that you can jump.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\">You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\">You may not cast or concentrate on spells, except for spells learned through this class and cast using spell points.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\">You have advantage on Constitution checks to resist having your concentration broken.</p></li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">Your rage lasts for 1 minute.
