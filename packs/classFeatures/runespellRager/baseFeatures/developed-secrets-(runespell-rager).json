You may learn any berserker developed talent for which you meet the prerequisites, using your runespell rager levels in place of berserker levels. The Developed Secrets column of the Runespell Rager table shows when you learn more developed secrets.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Whenever you learn an additional developed secret, you may instead learn a warlock secret of the arcana instead. You may not learn more than one warlock secret of the arcana through this feature. You may use your runespell rager level in place of warlock levels to meet these prerequisites.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, you may use your spellcasting ability in place of your Strength ability to determine your carrying capacity, including the amount of Supply and the number of bulky items you can carry.&nbsp;</p>",
