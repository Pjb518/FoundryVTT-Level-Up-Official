Choose one of the following:</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Invocation of the Courts:</strong>&nbsp;Your study into other realms has let you steal some of their secrets. You learn one invocation from the Invocation of the Courts warlock feature for which you meet the prerequisites. You may use runespell rager levels in place of warlock levels to meet these prerequisites.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Prescient Communication:</strong>&nbsp;Whispers of the spirits you commune with help you determine the most effective way to speak with another creature. Before attempting to persuade, deceive, or intimidate a creature, you may get a &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; feeling about the results of your efforts if you do succeed as if you had cast the augury spell. You may decide on a different course of action if you don&rsquo;t trust how you feel. You may use this feature once per short rest.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Warrior Born:</strong>&nbsp;You may choose one of the options granted by the Warrior Born berserker feature.&nbsp;</p></li></ul>",
