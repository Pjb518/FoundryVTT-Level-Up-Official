    "description": "<p>If you spend 10 minutes befriending and feeding a Medium or smaller beast of CR 1/8 or less, you become its guardian ranger. It follows you and is loyal to you, but it acts independently. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. The beast won\u2019t attack except as a reaction to being attacked, but it can take other actions as normal and makes death saving throws. You can only be a guardian ranger to one beast at a time.</p><p><br></p>",
