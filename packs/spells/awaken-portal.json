The door retains its hit points, AC, and other characteristics, and is considered an object. If the door is reduced to 0 hit points, it is killed and the spell ends.</p>\n<p>The door is able to open, close, lock, and unlock by itself, and can speak and understand one language that you know. If arcane lock is cast on the door, the door can activate and deactivate the spell at will. The door is friendly to you and follows your orders.</p>",
