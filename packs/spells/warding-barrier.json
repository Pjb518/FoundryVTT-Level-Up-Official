		"description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">As an attack lashes toward you, or a spell flies, you raise your hand to bring up a ward of force to protect yourself and those nearby.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a reaction to an attack that targets you, or being in the area of a damaging spell or other effect which requires a Dexterity saving throw, you create a temporary waist-high force field in front of you that provides half cover to you and anyone behind it as normal cover would. Creatures behind you, relative to the source of danger, also gain the benefit of cover. (Half cover grants a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws until the start of your next turn.)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-487c62d9-7fff-0468-bea6-bdc413276652\">Cast At Higher Levels.</strong> Using a 2nd level or higher spell slot creates an identical magical barrier in front of an additional creature you can see within 30 feet. You can create a second such barrier if you use a spell slot of at least 4th level, a third with a spell slot of at least 6th level (and the range increases to 60 feet), and a fourth with a spell slot of at least 8th level. All barriers created by this spell dissipate at the same time.</p>",
