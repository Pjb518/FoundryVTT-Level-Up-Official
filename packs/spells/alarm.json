		"description": "<p>You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion that alerts you whenever a creature of size Tiny or larger touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, choose any number of creatures. These creatures don't set off the alarm.</p><p>Choose whether the alarm is silent or audible. The silent alarm is heard in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area and it awakens you if you are sleeping. An audible alarm produces a loud noise of your choosing for 10 seconds within 60 feet.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> You may create an additional alarm for each slot level above 1st. The spell's range increases to 600 feet, but you must be familiar with the locations you ward, and all alarms must be set within the same physical structure. Setting off one alarm does not activate the other alarms.</p><p>You may choose one of the following effects in place of creating an additional alarm. The effects apply to all alarms created during the spell's casting.</p><p>Increased Duration. The spell's duration increases to 24 hours.</p><p>Improved Audible Alarm. The audible alarm produces any sound you choose and can be heard up to 300 feet away.</p><p>Improved Mental Alarm. The mental alarm alerts you regardless of your location, even if you and the alarm are on different planes of existence.</p>",
