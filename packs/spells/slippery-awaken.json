A plant targeted by this spell gains the ability to move, as well as senses identical to those of a human. The Narrator assigns awakened plant statistics (such as an awakened shrub or awakened tree).</p><p>The target is charmed by you for 30 days or until you or your companions harm it. Depending on how you treated the target while it was charmed, when the condition ends the awakened creature may choose to remain friendly to you.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> Target an additional creature for each slot level above 5th. Each target requires its own material component.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Rare: Slippery Awaken.</strong> Oozes can be targeted by this spell. </p>",
