Until the spell ends, creatures cannot gain bonuses (like those granted by bless or expertise dice) or advantage on attack rolls against you. In addition, none of your movement provokes opportunity attacks, and you ignore nonmagical difficult terrain. Finally, you can end the spell early to treat a single weapon attack roll as though you had rolled a 15 on the d20.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> For each slot level above 5th, you can also apply this spell's benefits to an additional creature you can see within 30 feet.</p>",
