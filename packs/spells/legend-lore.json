The spell gives you additional, more detailed information if you already have some knowledge of the target. The spell will not return any information for items not of legendary renown.</p><p>The knowledge you gain is always true, but may be obscured by metaphor, poetic language, or verse.</p><p>If you use the spell for a cursed tome, for instance, you may gain knowledge of the dire words spoken by its creator as they brought it into the world.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> Your intuition surrounding the target is enhanced and you gain advantage on one Investigation check regarding it for each slot level above 6th.</p>",
