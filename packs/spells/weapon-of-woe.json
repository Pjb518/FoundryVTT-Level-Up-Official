		"description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">You form a baleful weapon out of magical energy to attack your foes. It counts as a simple melee weapon you are proficient with. It deals 2d8 points of damage of your choice from one of the following types: acid, cold, fire, necrotic, poison, or psychic. The weapon has up to three of the following properties: defensive (any), finesse, parrying, parrying immunity, thrown (20/60), trip. If you drop the weapon, the spell ends early. If you throw it, it reappears in your hand immediately after hitting or missing.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Cast At Higher Levels.</strong> If you cast this spell with a slot of at least 3rd level, you can also select breaker (any), reach (10&rsquo;) and vicious properties. If you cast it with a spell slot of at least 4th level, it deals 3d8 damage. If you cast it with a spell slot of at least 5th level, you can select the versatile property (which increases the damage dice to d10s if wielded two-handed). If you cast it with a spell slot of at least 6th level, it deals 4d8 damage. If you cast it with a 7th level spell, you can select the 2-handed property, which increases the damage dice to d12s. If you cast it with at least an 8th-level spell, it deals 5d8. If you cast it with a 9th-level spell, the weapon may have up to 5 properties.</p>",
