Your head appears backlit no matter which angle you are viewed from. You shed bright light to a distance of 30 feet and dim light for an additional 30 feet. When a creature attacks you in melee, you may use your reaction to cause the light to flare, potentially blinding your attacker. The attacking creature must make a Constitution save against your spell save DC. If it fails, it is blinded until the end of its next turn and rolls the triggering attack with disadvantage. Once a creature has had this blinding effect used on it, you cannot use it on that same creature again with the same casting of Shroud of Glory.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, creatures that see you while this spell&rsquo;s effects are active have disadvantage on checks to remember anything about you except for the brilliant light or to recognize you later if they see you again.
