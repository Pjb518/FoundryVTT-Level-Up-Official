The spell cannot return an undead creature to life.</p><p>The spell cures any poisons and nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time of death. It does not remove any magical diseases, curses, or other magical effects; these must be removed prior to the spell being cast, otherwise they immediately take effect when the creature returns to life.</p><p>The spell does not regrow limbs or organs, and it automatically fails if the target is missing any body parts necessary for life (like its heart or head).</p><p>Being raised from the dead takes a toll on the body, mind, and spirit. The target suffers 3 levels of fatigue and strife. At the conclusion of each long rest, the target removes one level of fatigue and strife until the target completely recovers.</p>",
