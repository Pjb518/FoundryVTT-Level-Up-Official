    "description": "<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-298f3c66-7fff-30cb-234a-060660145fc3\" dir=\"ltr\">You touch a broom and bring it to life. The broom stands and moves on its own, and will follow you unless commanded to stay in place. You may issue basic commands to the broom, such as instructing it on a specific spot that needs cleaning. If no commands are issued, the broom will start to idly clean the immediate area. An animated broom can completely sweep a 10-foot by 10-foot space in 1 minute, thoroughly removing dust, debris, and signs of foot traffic, such as tracks.</p><p id=\"docs-internal-guid-6bd4e491-7fff-311d-2080-ed790b716ddb\" dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Rare Version:</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Cordelia&rsquo;s Cooperative Witch&rsquo;s Broom.</strong> The spell&rsquo;s duration increases to 10 minutes. Additionally, the broom sprouts a pair of arms and can perform basic tasks, such as carrying objects for you or providing an extra pair of hands to assist you. If summoned in combat, the broom cannot attack, but it can flank an enemy.</p>",
