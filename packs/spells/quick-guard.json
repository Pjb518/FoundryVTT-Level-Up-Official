		"description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">You whip your shield around to protect yourself, bolstering it with magic as you do.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You may cast this spell whenever you are targeted by an attack or whenever you are targeted with a hostile spell or ability that would deal damage to you. If your shield is not already equipped, this spell equips it as part of the casting (potentially raising your AC and canceling the attack). If you are holding something that would prevent you from equipping your shield, you drop it at your feet as part of the casting of this spell. In addition, you gain resistance to any damage done by the triggering attack or effect and gain an expertise die on any saving throws it imposes. This spell provides no protection against an effect with an area such as a dragon&rsquo;s breath or a fireball spell.</p>",
