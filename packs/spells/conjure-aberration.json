		"description": "<p>You wrench open a hole in reality and summon a creature from the cracks between the planes. This creature uses the statistics of a conjured aberration. In addition, roll 1d4 or choose the aberration&rsquo;s general appearance.</p><ol><li>Squid-like</li><li>Writhing ball of body parts</li><li>Humanoid with featureless face</li><li>Translucent worm</li></ol><p>The creature is friendly to you and your companions and takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands. Without such commands, the creature only defends itself. The creature disappears when reduced to 0 hit points. If your concentration is broken before the spell ends, you lose control of the aberration, which becomes hostile and attacks you and your companions. An uncontrolled creature disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.</p><p><em><strong>Cast at Higher Levels</strong></em>. For each slot level above 5th, the aberration&rsquo;s AC increases by 1, its hit points increase by 10, and when it deals damage with an attack it deals 1d4 extra damage.</p>",
