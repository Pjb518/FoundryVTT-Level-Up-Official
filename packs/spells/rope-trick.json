At the upper end, a nearly imperceptible entrance opens to an extradimensional space that can fit up to 8 Medium or smaller creatures. The entrance can be reached by climbing the rope. Once inside, the rope can be pulled into the extradimensional space.</p><p>No spells or attacks can cross into or out of the extradimensional space. Creatures inside the extradimensional space can see out of a 3-foot-by- 5-foot window centered on its entrance. Creatures outside the space can spot the entrance with a Perception check against your spell save DC. If they can reach it, creatures can pass in and out of the space.</p><p>When the spell ends, anything inside the extradimensional space falls to the ground.</p>",
