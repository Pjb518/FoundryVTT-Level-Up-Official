If there is not a point in the air above you that the storm cloud could appear, the spell fails (such as if you are in a small cavern or indoors).</p><p>On the round you cast it, and as an action on subsequent turns until the spell ends, you can call down a bolt of lightning to a point directly beneath the cloud. Each creature within 5 feet of the point makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.</p><p>If you are outdoors in a storm when you cast this spell, you take control of the storm instead of creating a new cloud and the spell's damage is increased by 1d10.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>",
