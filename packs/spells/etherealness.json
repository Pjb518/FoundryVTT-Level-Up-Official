    "description": "<p>Until the spell ends or you use an action to end it, you step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane where it overlaps with your current plane. While on the Ethereal Plane, you can move in any direction, but vertical movement is considered difficult terrain. You can see and hear the plane you originated from, but everything looks desaturated and you can see no further than 60 feet.</p><p>While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures on that plane. Creatures not on the Ethereal Plane can't perceive you unless some special ability or magic explicitly allows them to.</p><p>When the spell ends, you immediately return to the plane you originated from in the spot you currently occupy. If you occupy the same spot as a solid object or creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and you take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.</p><p>The spell has no effect if you cast it while you are on the Ethereal Plane or a plane that doesn't border it, such as an Outer Plane.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> You can target up to 3 willing creatures within 10 feet (including you) for each slot level above 7th.</p>",
