		"description": "<p>This spell creates a sound or image of an object.</p><p>The illusion disappears if dismissed or you cast the spell again.</p><p>You may create any sound you choose, ranging in volume from a whisper to a scream. You may choose one sound for the duration or change them at varying points before the spell ends. Sounds are audible outside the spell's area.</p><p>Visual illusions may replicate any image and remain within the spell's area, but cannot create sound, light, smell, or other sensory effects.</p><p>The image is revealed as an illusion with any physical interaction as physical objects and creatures pass through it. An Investigation check against your spell save DC also reveals the image is an illusion. When a creature realizes the image is an illusion, the effects become fainter for that creature.</p>",
