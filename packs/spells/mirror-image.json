With two copies, a roll of 8 or higher targets a copy, and with 1 copy a roll of 11 or higher targets the copy.</p><p>A copy's AC is 10 + your Dexterity modifier, and when it is hit by an attack a copy is destroyed.</p><p>It may be destroyed only by an attack that hits it.</p><p>All other damage and effects have no impact.</p><p>Attacking creatures that have truesight, cannot see, have blindsight, or rely on other nonvisual senses are unaffected by this spell.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> When using a 5th-level spell slot, the duration increases to concentration (1 hour).</p>",
