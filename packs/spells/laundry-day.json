Threadbare or worn laundry is restored to as new condition, and even extremely damaged laundry (bloodstained, cut to tatters in a combat, etc.) is restored. As long as at least half the material that comprises an article of laundry is present, it can be restored by this spell. This spell leaves no trace that the object was damaged.</p>\n<p>This spell affects anything made of cloth, so even rugs, small sails, and tapestries may be restored. Magic items and constructs may be repaired in this way, but their magic is not restored.
