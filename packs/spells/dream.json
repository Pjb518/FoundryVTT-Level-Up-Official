		"description": "<p>Until the spell ends, you manipulate the dreams of another creature. You designate a messenger, which may be you or a willing creature you touch, to enter a trance. The messenger remains aware of its surroundings while in the trance but cannot take actions or move.</p><p>If the target is sleeping the messenger appears in its dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep and the spell remains active. The messenger can also manipulate the dream, creating objects, landscapes, and various other sensory sensations. The messenger can choose to end the trance at any time, ending the spell. The target remembers the dream in perfect detail when it wakes. The messenger knows if the target is awake when you cast the spell and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the spell works as described.</p><p>You can choose to let the messenger terrorize the target. The messenger can deliver a message of 10 words or fewer and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you have a portion of the target's body (some hair or a drop of blood) it has disadvantage on its saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the messenger's fearful aspect create a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target's sleep and prevents it from gaining any benefit from the rest. In addition, upon waking the target suffers a level of fatigue or strife (your choice), up to a maximum of 3 in either condition.</p><p>Creatures that don't sleep or don't dream (such as elves) cannot be contacted by this spell.</p>",
