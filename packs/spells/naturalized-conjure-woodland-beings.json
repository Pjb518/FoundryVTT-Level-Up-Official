		"description": "<p>You summon up to 3 creatures from The Dreaming. These creatures use the statistics of a woodland being (detailed below) with certain traits determined by your choice of its type: blink dog, satyr, or sprite. If you summon only 2 creatures with this spell, increase its effective slot level by 1 when determining the minor woodland being's statistics, and if you summon a single creature with this spell its effective slot level is increased by 2 instead.</p><p>The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions and take their turns immediately after yours. They obey your verbal commands. When you command multiple woodland beings using this spell, you must give them all the same command.</p><p>Without such commands, a summoned creature only defends itself.</p><p>The summoned creature disappears when reduced to 0 hit points. If your concentration is broken before the spell ends, you lose control of any summoned creatures, which become hostile and might attack you and your companions. An uncontrolled creature disappears at the end of the spell's maximum duration.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> Use the higher spell slot level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Rare: Naturalized Conjure Animals.</strong> This spell does not require your concentration.</p>",
