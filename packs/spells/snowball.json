		"description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Choose a point within 180 ft. A medium sized snowball appears in a space of your choosing and begins rolling in a direction of your choosing at a speed of 60ft per round in a straight 5ft wide line. This snowball deals 1d6 points of cold damage per 15ft moved and knocks a medium size or smaller creature prone, with a constitution save for half damage and to avoid being knocked prone. Tiny or smaller creatures that fail the saving throw are picked up by the snowball, and carried for the remainder of its duration. If it strikes a medium or larger creature or object during this first turn, it stops and the spell ends.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the second turn, the snowball becomes large sized at the beginning of your turn, and continues moving in the direction you specified as a 10ft wide line. It now deals 4d6 cold damage, plus 1d6 per additional 15ft moved, and stops when it strikes a large or larger creature or object, ending the spell. Small or smaller creatures in the area must make a constitution save to avoid being swept up into it and carried for the remainder of its duration.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the 3rd turn, the snowball becomes huge sized at the beginning of your turn, and continues moving in the direction you specified as a 15ft wide line. It now deals 8d6 cold damage, plus 1d6 per additional 15ft moved, and stops when it strikes a huge or larger creature or object, ending the spell. Medium or smaller creatures in the area must make a constitution save to avoid being swept up into it and carried to the end of its journey.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If the spell ends while carrying creatures, roll 1d4 for each creature to determine how far from the spell&rsquo;s end the creature lands and select a random square within that distance of the spell&rsquo;s end. Creatures deposited in this way take an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage and are prone.</p>",
