		"description": "<div id=\"spell-body\">\n<div class=\"field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item\">\n<p>You create a window roughly 4 inches square, centered on the point that you touch. If the surface is more than 1 foot thick or made of materials other than wood, dirt, or stone, the spell fails. The window is sufficiently braced to prevent any structural weakening to the surrounding structure, but otherwise is just a small hole you can look through. The hole lasts for 1 minute, then vanishes. The hole can also be dismissed by the caster as a bonus action. Creatures in this space when the window vanishes are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take 1d6 force damage for every square moved.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;\">Cast at Higher Levels.<em> </em></strong><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt;\">For each slot level beyond 2nd, you can choose one of the following features:</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"field field--name-field-spellcast-at-higher-levels field--type-text-long field--label-inline\">\n<div class=\"field--item\">\n<ul>\n<li>Glass pane: the window comes with a pane of glass (AC 5, 2 hit points), which functions as a normal window pane, keeping rain, outside air, etc. out and inside air in.</li>\n<li>Small-sized: the window is of sufficient diameter for a Small-sized creature to squeeze through as an action.</li>\n<li>Medium-sized (counts as two features):the window is of sufficient diameter for a Medium creature to squeeze through as an action.
