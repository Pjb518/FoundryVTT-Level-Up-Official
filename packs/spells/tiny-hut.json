		"description": "<p>You create an immobile dome of protective force that provides shelter and can be used as a safe haven (Chapter 4: Exploration in Trials &amp; Treasures). The dome is of a color of your choosing, can't be seen through from the outside, is transparent on the inside, and can fit up to 10 Medium creatures (including you) within.</p>\n<p class=\"preFade fadeIn\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 0.9s; transition-delay: 0.212791s;\">The dome prevents inclement weather and environmental effects from passing through it and bars any creature not within the spell&rsquo;s area when you cast it from entering, though creatures and objects that were within the spell&rsquo;s area may pass through freely. You can also allow a specific creature to enter the space, as long as there are not currently 10 creatures inside. Spells and other magical effects can&rsquo;t cross the dome in either direction, and the dome provides a comfortable dry interior no matter the conditions outside of it. You can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark at any time on your turn.</p>\n<p class=\"preFade fadeIn\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 0.9s; transition-delay: 0.214535s;\">The spell fails if a Large or larger creature or more than 10 creatures are inside the affected area when you cast the spell. The spell ends when you leave the dome or if more than 10 creatures enter the dome.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
