		"description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">You call upon the strange power you have harnessed to produce a variety of useful effects. Choose one:&nbsp;</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">An eye with an appearance of your choosing opens on your body. You can see through the eye, and if it is in a useful place (such as the back of your head or on a hand you can use to look around corners with) it may, at the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion, give you an Expertise die on Perception checks. It closes and disappears when the spell ends.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Darkness or magical energy swirls around your feet. While the spell lasts, you are lightly obscured.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Spectral insects of a type of your choosing flutter, buzz, or crawl around your space and body.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Your touch causes things you touch to lose some of their essence - colors bleach, food becomes less flavorful, light becomes pale rather than warm. Whatever you touch returns to normal when the spell ends.&nbsp;</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">You emit a high-pitched sound in a 20-foot sphere around yourself that most creatures can&rsquo;t consciously perceive, but find irritating just the same. Checks to maintain concentration are made with a -1d4 penalty while this effect is active. Some creatures may also decide to be somewhere else, finding you too annoying to hang around.</p></li></ul>",
