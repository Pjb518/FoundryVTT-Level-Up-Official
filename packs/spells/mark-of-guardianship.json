You know its exact direction if you are within 10 miles, and its precise location if you are within 100 feet of it. Whenever you use a spell or feature to heal the creature, you may reroll any die rolls of 1 when determining how many hit points you restore. You must use the new roll, even if it is also a 1.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-70488012-7fff-a0fd-1d79-8dc340ca67fb\">Cast at Higher Levels.</strong> If you cast this with a spell slot of at least 2nd level, you also know whether the creature is at full health, at less than full health but not bloodied, bloodied, unconscious and making death saves, unconscious but stable, or dead. If you cast it with at least a 3rd-level spell slot, in addition to the above benefits any healing you do to the creature increases by an additional 1d4. This additional healing increases by an additional 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd. If you cast it with at least a 4th-level spell slot, the duration increases to 24 hours. If you cast it with at least a 5th-level spell slot, the duration increases to a week.</p>",
