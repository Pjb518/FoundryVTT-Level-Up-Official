		"description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">You ward an area allowing you to stand guard over your companions who sleep secure beneath your protection.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">While the spell is active, as long as you remain within the spell&rsquo;s area, you gain darkvision with a range of 300 feet and make all Perception checks with advantage. You do not suffer the effects of a missed rest and are able to stay alert and vigilant for the entire night. You recover spell slots normally, but do not gain the other benefits of a rest such as restoring hit points, hit dice, or other resources such as those provided by your class, archetype, heritage, and/or feats. You may magically wake any number of creatures sleeping within the spell&rsquo;s area as a bonus action.</p><p>Invisible creatures that approach the salt line that defines the edge of the area become quasi-visible (treat as lightly obscured) when they are 10 feet away and become fully visible and outlined in a faerie fire effect that persists for one minute if they cross the line. Creatures on the ethereal plane cannot cross into the spell&rsquo;s area.</p><p>Friendly creatures sleeping in the area gain the effects of a long rest in a sanctuary if they finish a long rest there.</p>",
