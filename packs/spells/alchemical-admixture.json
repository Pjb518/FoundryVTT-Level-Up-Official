		"description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">You fuse a pair of potions or alchemical items into a single whole that can function as either or both.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">When you cast this spell, choose two items from the following list: acid, adderwort roots, alchemist&rsquo;s fire, antitoxin, dried yewclaw bark, fairy cap, holy water, an ironwood acorn, laudanum, lavender paste, a paint pot, any potion, any poison, or pressed spiderbulb, (the narrator may include additional items at their discretion).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The items must be different and one must not be a stronger version of the other (in other words, you can&rsquo;t combine two types of poison, even named ones, or two different strengths of healing potion) if you attempt an invalid item combination, both items are wasted and lost.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">You also choose three command words. The two items disappear and fuse into a single softly-glowing liquid that appears in a standard-sized potion vial. As a bonus action, you can speak one of the command words, allowing you to choose one effect, the other, or both. For the next eight hours, the potion functions as the selected item or combination of items and may be used accordingly.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If the two items are used differently (such as being thrown for alchemist&rsquo;s fire and swallowed for a healing potion) you cannot choose the &ldquo;both&rdquo; option.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">After the spell&rsquo;s duration ends, the combined item loses its potency and is treated as non-potable water.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Cast at Higher Levels.</strong> If you cast this spell with a third-level spell or higher slot, you may choose the &ldquo;both&rdquo; option for items with different use cases. If you do, whenever you use the item, the effect of the other takes effect on any target affected by the first. For example, if you choose alchemist&rsquo;s fire and an ingested poison, the poison affects any target affected by the alchemist&rsquo;s fire and vice versa.</p>",
