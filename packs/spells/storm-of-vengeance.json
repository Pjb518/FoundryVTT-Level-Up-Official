    "description": "<p>You conjure a churning storm cloud that spreads to cover the target area. As it forms, lightning and thunder mix with howling winds, and each creature beneath the cloud makes a Constitution saving throw or takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 5 minutes.</p><p>Until the spell ends, at the start of your turn the cloud produces additional effects: Round 2. Acidic rain falls throughout the area dealing 1d6 acid damage to each creature and object beneath the cloud.</p><p>Round 3. Lightning bolts strike up to 6 creatures or objects of your choosing that are beneath the cloud (no more than one bolt per creature or object). A creature struck by this lightning makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful save.</p><p>Round 4. Hailstones fall throughout the area dealing 2d6 bludgeoning damage to each creature beneath the cloud.</p><p>Round 5–10. Gusts and freezing rain turn the area beneath the cloud into difficult terrain that is heavily obscured. Ranged weapon attacks are impossible while a creature or its target are beneath the cloud. When a creature concentrating on a spell starts its turn beneath the cloud or enters into the area, it makes a Constitution saving throw or loses concentration. Gusts of strong winds between 20–50 miles per hour automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar effects (whether mundane or magical). Finally, each creature beneath the cloud takes 1d6 cold damage.</p>",
