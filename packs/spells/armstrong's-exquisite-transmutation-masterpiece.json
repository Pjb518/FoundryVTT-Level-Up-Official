		"description": "<p>You draw a transmutation circle around the target, invoking its alchemical composition and envisioning what it could become. You reshape the target into a new form made of the same substance, conserving mass. For example, you can reshape clothing into rope, electrum coins into gold and silver bars, bricks into a clay jar, or scrap metal into a weapon.&nbsp;</p><p>The quality of objects made by the spell is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials. Items requiring a high degree of craftsmanship (jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor) can only be created if you have proficiency with the type of tools used to craft such objects. Creatures and magic items can’t be created or transmuted by this spell. Material which is part of a larger object (such as 2 cubic feet of bricks in a wall or the hinges of a locked door) cannot be targeted by this spell.</p><p><strong><em>Armstrong's Exquisite Transmutation Masterpiece.</em></strong> When you cast this spell, choose one tool. You are considered proficient with it for the casting of this spell.</p>",
