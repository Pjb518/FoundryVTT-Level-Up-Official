		"description": "<p><strong>Classes:&nbsp;</strong>Warlock, Wizard</p><p>You summon a powerful demon from the depth of the Abyss. The creature has the statistics of a <em>Demonic Creature</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>The creature is friendly to you and your companions and takes its turn immediately after yours.</p><p>It obeys your verbal commands. Without such commands, the creature only defends itself.</p><p>Demons are unruly and difficult to control at the best of times, and even more so the more powerful they become. When you finish casting this spell, you must make a spellcasting ability check opposed by the creatures charisma check. On a failure you lose control of the creature for 1d4 rounds, after which you automatically assert dominance and take control of it. You can choose to give yourself advantage on this check at the cost of taking 1d6 psychic damage per spell slot level if you fail, and may spend your action to make another opposed check, regaining control early on a success. Any time you succeed on a concentration check for this spell with a DC higher than 10 while the creature is under your control, you must repeat this check, losing control for 1d4 rounds on a failure.</p><p>The creature disappears when reduced to 0 hit points. If your concentration is broken before the spell ends, you lose control of the creature, which becomes hostile and might attack you and your companions. An uncontrolled creature disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> For each slot level above 7th the creature's AC increases by 1, its hit points increase by 10, and when it deals damage with an attack it deals 1d6 extra damage.</p><hr><p><strong>Rare: Elmeriko's Chaotic Conjure Greater Demon. </strong>When using rapid summoning to cast this spell, the spell does not require concentration, but any demonic creature summoned gains an expertise die on any opposed checks to resist your control.</p>",
