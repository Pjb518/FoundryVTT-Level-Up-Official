You have disadvantage on this save if you have the Good alignment trait.</p><p>The creature is friendly to you and your companions and takes its turn immediately after yours.</p><p>It obeys your verbal commands. Without such commands, the creature only defends itself.</p><p>The creature disappears when reduced to 0 hit points. If your concentration is broken before the spell ends, you lose control of the creature, which becomes hostile and might attack you and your companions. An uncontrolled creature disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> For each slot level above 5th the <em>fiendish creature</em>'s AC increases by 1, its hit points increase by 10, and when it deals damage with an attack it deals 1d4 extra damage. This additional damage is fire for the nightmare's hoof attack.</p><hr><p><strong>Rare: Mortha's Wicked Conjure Fiend. </strong>When using rapid summoning to cast this spell, the spell does not require concentration.&nbsp;</p>",
