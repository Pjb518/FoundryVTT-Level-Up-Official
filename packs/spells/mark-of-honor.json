While the mark persists, members of your faith, order, or similar can automatically perceive the mark, even through disguises or concealment, and will know its significance, causing the target to be treated with the same trust and regard as a full member of the organization. Its effective prestige also increases by +1 with sympathetic individuals and institutions for the duration of the spell.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If you attempt to cast this spell on a member of the same organization you belong to such as your religious order, knightly order, or a closely-allied one, it automatically fails and you suffer a level of strife. If you attempt to cast this spell on yourself, it fails and you gain 2 levels of strife.</p>",
