The other end of the portal appears within 5 feet of you and you suffer a level of strife.</p><p>A creature within 5 feet of either end of the portal can use 5 feet of movement to step through, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the other end. If there is no such space, it is moved to the nearest unoccupied space, taking 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet moved. The portal remains open for as long as you maintain concentration and remain within 5 feet of one end of it, but for the duration of your concentration you suffer an additional level of strife at the end of each of your turns after the first.</p>",
