		"description": "<p>You call a Tiny beast to you, whisper a message to it, and then give it directions to the message's recipient. It is now your messenger.</p><p>Specify a location you have previously visited and a recipient who matches a general description, such as &quot;a person wearing a pointed red hat in Barter Town&quot; or &quot;a half-orc in a wheelchair at the Striped Lion Inn.&quot; Speak a message of up to 25 words. For the duration of the spell, the messenger travels towards the location at a rate of 50 miles per day for a messenger with a flying speed, or else 25 miles without.</p><p>When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the first creature matching your description, replicating the sound of your voice exactly. If the messenger can't find the recipient or reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The duration of the spell increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd.</p>",
