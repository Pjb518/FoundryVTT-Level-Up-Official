On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect, but the creature can use its reaction to reshape the fraying magic and cast another spell with the same casting time as the original spell.</p><p>This new spell must be cast at a spell slot level equal to or less than half the original spell slot.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than the level of the spell slot used to cast this spell, or if both spells use the same level spell slot an opposed spellcasting ability check is made.</p>",
