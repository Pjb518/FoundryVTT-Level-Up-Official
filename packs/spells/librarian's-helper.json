You may choose to hide up to 5 tiny items among the stacks. Investigation checks to find these items have a DC equal to your spell save DC.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The notebook used in the casting of the spell fills with one of three types of text chosen when you cast the spell:</p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The first option is to have the notebook fill itself with a full catalog of the collected materials. If you select this option, as long as the collection doesn&rsquo;t change substantially and you retain the notebook, you gain a d6 expertise die on all Investigation checks to research things using the collected materials as long as the Narrator determines they contain useful information and you can read them.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The second option is that the notebook fills up with notes on where to find information on a specific topic of your choice in the collection. If you select this option, as long as the collection doesn&rsquo;t change substantially and you retain the notebook, you make a single Investigation check to find information on a specific topic with advantage.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The third option is the notebook fills up with information necessary to help you understand texts you cannot read. This will let you know how to begin piecing together a guide to translate a dead language or break the cipher in some encoded text. The specifics of this are up to the Narrator.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
