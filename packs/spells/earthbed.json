		"description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">You lie down and the earth swallows you, pulling you into a healing embrace.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For the duration of the spell, you are buried in the earth in a state of suspended animation and do not need to eat, drink, or breathe. You have total cover and concealment and while you can be located with magic or by digging, there is no obvious sign of your presence on the surface. If you remain buried for the spell&rsquo;s entire duration, you emerge fully restored. This spell ends any and all conditions affecting you (including all accumulated levels of Fatigue and Strife and Doomed), neutralizes all poisons and diseases affecting you, and restores all hit dice and hit points. At your option, you can allow this process to transform you, emerging as a different creature as if reincarnation had been cast on&nbsp; your body.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, if you are dug up and attacked during the spell&rsquo;s duration, you are vulnerable to all damage and do not awaken from taking it (a friendly creature can awaken you with a Medicine check with a DC equal to your spell save DC; each attempt to wake you takes 1 minute). If you die this way, you cannot be restored to life by any means short of true resurrection or wish.</p>",
