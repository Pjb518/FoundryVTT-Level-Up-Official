		"description": "<p>A permanent, immovable zone of antimagic fills the area, suppressing all magical effects within it. At the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion, sufficiently powerful artifacts and deities may be able to ignore the zone&rsquo;s effects. The zone is dispelled only if more than 10 percent of its area overlaps with that of another antimagic zone spell (which is also dispelled).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Area Suppression</em></strong>: When a magical effect protrudes into the zone, that part of the effect&rsquo;s area is suppressed. For example, the ice created by a wall of ice is suppressed within the zone, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Creatures and Objects</strong></em>: While within the zone, any creatures or objects created or conjured by magic temporarily wink out of existence, reappearing immediately once the space they occupied is no longer within the zone.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Dispel Magic</em></strong>: The sphere is immune to dispel magic and similar magical effects, including antimagic field spells.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Magic Items</em></strong>: While within the zone, magic items function as if they were mundane objects. Magic weapons and ammunition cease to be suppressed when they fully leave the zone.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Magical Travel</em></strong>: Whether the zone includes a destination or departure point, any planar travel or teleportation within it automatically fails. Until the spell ends or the zone moves, magical portals and extradimensional spaces (such as that created by a bag of holding ) within the zone are closed.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Spells</strong></em>: Any spell cast within the zone or at a target within the zone is suppressed and the spell slot is consumed. Active spells and magical effects are also suppressed within the zone. If a spell or magical effect has a duration, time spent suppressed counts against it.</p>",
