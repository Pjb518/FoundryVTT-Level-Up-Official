		"description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">You magically expand and harden your insides to hold a tremendous amount of&hellip; whatever you can fit in your mouth.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You may consume up to 5 gallons of objects you could swallow or liquid. You are unaffected by the presence of the objects in your body, allowing yourself to eat dirt, nails, coins, or poison. Chewing is optional; you could swallow a bunch of small stones, for example. For the next hour, you may either regurgitate a gallon&rsquo;s worth of objects or liquid whenever you wish. This expulsion can be gentle, allowing you to just spit something into your hand as a bonus action, or violent, allowing you to spray a 15&rsquo; cone of the swallowed substance as a bonus action. If the substance is normally damaging, it deals damage as usual (count as a hit from a single flask of something like acid or alchemist&rsquo;s fire).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You may swallow multiple different things, but each takes up a gallon&rsquo;s worth of space, minimum. For example, you could swallow a gallon of holy water, a gallon of sand, a handful of pebbles, a single key, and 30 copper pieces.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When the hour expires, you regurgitate anything remaining in your magical gullet at your feet.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-b800a299-7fff-5d74-8ba5-4b7bc1c24e46\">Cast at Higher Levels. </strong>The duration increases by an hour for each spell slot level above 2nd.</p>",
