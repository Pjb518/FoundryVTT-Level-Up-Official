		"description": "<p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, make a ranged weapon attack against a target within range of the weapon you are wielding. On a hit, the creature takes normal weapon damage and you may immediately roll a second attack against another target within 30 feet of the first as the shot penetrates through the initial target and keeps going. If the ammunition has some additional effect applied to it (such as poison, a spell, a class feature effect, etc.) it only affects the first target.</p><p>At 5th level, you may select a 2nd additional target if you hit the first, at 11th level you may select a 3rd if you hit the first two, and at 17th, you may select a 4th if you hit the first three. A single target may be targeted by multiple attacks as long as they are not consecutive. For example, at 5th level, if the first attack hits, and the second attack hits (a different target), the third attack may be directed back to the initial target.</p>",
