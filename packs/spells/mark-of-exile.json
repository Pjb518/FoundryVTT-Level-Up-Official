		"description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">You brand the target (which takes 1d4 points of fire damage) with a mark indicating they are forbidden from a place you specify. The specified location can be as small as a 5&rsquo; square or as large as a city. You must have the divine or legal authority to ban the creature from the location you specify or the spell fails.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thereafter, whenever the creature enters the forbidden location, it feels a creeping sense of dread and very badly wants to leave. It is rattled for the first minute in the location. Thereafter, it must make a Wisdom saving throw every 10 minutes, becoming frightened of the location. If the creature manages to stay in the location for 30 minutes, it must make a Charisma saving throw every 10 minutes thereafter (in addition to the Wisdom saving throw) or suffer 1d6 points of psychic damage. If it manages to stay for an hour or more, it must make an Intelligence saving throw (in addition to the Wisdom and Charisma saving throws) every 10 minutes or gain a level of strife.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">None of these penalties beyond the initial rattling effect persist if you or your allies prevent the creature from leaving.</p>",
