		"description": "<p>In your hands, simple cut flowers and bits of green leaves become elaborate works of art that decorate the tables of nobility or are carried by celebrants at festivals and weddings. You know how to artfully blend color and texture, weaving together just the right flowers for special days. You also know that flowers are more than just pretty to look at&mdash;they can be their own form of language too.</p>\n<p>Why have you left your shop or your stall on adventure? Do you seek rare flowers that lie beyond your homeland to further dazzle your clientele? Or has a blight struck the countryside, causing all of your beloved blooms to wither and die?</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increases:</strong> +1 to Charisma and one other ability score.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies: </strong>Culture, and either Persuasion or Nature</p>\n<p><strong>Suggested Equipment (Cost 8 gold):</strong> Basket, common clothes, dagger, string (10 feet), 5 vials&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Feature: Language of Flowers.</strong></em> You are able to use flowers to craft hidden messages. So long as you have 10 minutes and access to flowers, you may create a bouquet that conveys a secret message of 15 words or less. Creatures attempting to decipher this message make an Insight check versus your passive Deception score.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Adventure and Advancement.</strong></em> When people learn that you are a florist, they may request bouquets for friends, lovers, or for &nbsp;a festival. If you complete these tasks, you and your allies may receive free accommodations.</p>\n<p>If you complete enough of these tasks, word of your talents spreads and you may be contacted by nobility, who will willingly meet with you and invite you into their homes.</p>\n<h3>Florist Connections</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The person you learned your flower craft from: your grandmother, your father, or a master florist.</li>\n<li>An admirer or lover who always left flowers on your desk&mdash;until they went missing.</li>\n<li>Someone of importance who caught you leaving a nasty message in the language of flowers.</li>\n<li>A wealthy baron or baroness who insists that you (and only you!) make the centerpieces for their banquet tables.</li>\n<li>A rival florist who stole your best client.</li>\n<li>Your last client, for whom you designed a wedding bouquet.</li>\n<li>The old woman who stops to buy her wife flowers every week.</li>\n<li>The head of a local temple, who always commissions you for flowers on feast days.</li>\n<li>The cottage gardener who provides you with your best peonies.</li>\n<li>The mysterious stranger who keeps leaving you coded bouquets. Who are they?</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Florist Mementos</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>A pair of inherited floral scissors.</li>\n<li>The preserved bloom of your favorite flower.</li>\n<li>A drawing of a rare flower you saw once&mdash;and only once.</li>\n<li>Your sketchbook with all of your designs.</li>\n<li>A satchel or basket to collect new flower samples.</li>\n<li>A dried flower from your mother&rsquo;s wedding bouquet.</li>\n<li>A tiny glass bud vase that you brought along.</li>\n<li>A small stack of fine stationary to put with your bouquets.</li>\n<li>A locket with a pressed flower from a loved one.</li>\n<li><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-57c920ca-7fff-bc62-3861-0540ba7359e5\">A small bag of elegant ribbons.</span></li>\n</ol>",
