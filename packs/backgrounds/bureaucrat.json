		"description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Mayors, magistrates, politicians, functionaries, and other civil servants. When rule of law becomes more than just a monarch&rsquo;s word (such as in the case of constitutional monarchies, democracies, and certain theocracies), the government swells in size as legal documentation demands a workforce of office workers&mdash;as well as elected and appointed officials. Given the diverse and isolated nature of politics in the world of fantasy, the bureaucrat might have limited influence outside their faction&mdash;or they might be highly coveted for their experience and transferable skills.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Do you consider yourself a servant of the people, or are you the ambitious type with your eyes on the prize of power? Are you the type to seek out institutional change, or do you take pride in &ldquo;minding your business&rdquo; and &ldquo;doing your job?&rdquo; How does one with your status find themselves in the adventuring life? Are you tossed into circumstances beyond your control, or have you lost the good graces of the government?&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Bureaucrat Traits</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Ability Score Increases:</strong> +1 to Intelligence and one other ability score.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Culture, and either History, Insight, or Persuasion.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Calligrapher's supplies</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Language Proficiencies:</strong> Any two of your choice</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Suggested Equipment (Cost 30 gold): </strong>Calligrapher&rsquo;s supplies, fine clothes, signet ring&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Feature: Civil Service.</strong>&nbsp;While in a settlement in which you can establish a connection with the government, you can ply your trade as a civil servant (such as campaigning, performing inspections, meetings with important people, or doing office work) to earn yourself an income granting you a rich lifestyle. While plying your trade in this way, you can Gather Information simultaneously at no penalty.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Alternatively, when you Gather Information while not plying your trade in this way, you gain advantage on Persuasion, Deception, and Intimidation checks to draw closer to a political faction or movement.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Adventures and Advancement.&nbsp;</strong>After enough adventures, you become elected or appointed to a position of increased power. (This may be gratitude expressed by your faction, a restoration to your faction&rsquo;s good graces, or the reward for joining a new faction.) Within your Prestige Center, your Prestige Rating counts as 1 higher, granting you better audiences and influence. You also gain the service of 4 functionaries (inexperienced scribes), who are on your faction&rsquo;s payroll but work for you.</p>",
