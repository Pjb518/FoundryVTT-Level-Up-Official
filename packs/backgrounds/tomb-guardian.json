This new command will come with occasional responsibilities and you may even have to repel an incursion from time to time.</p>\n<h3><strong>Tomb Guardian Connections</strong></h3>\n<p>1. Another guard that you became friends with during many an interminable shift together.</p>\n<p>2. The architect that designed the tomb you guarded.</p>\n<p>3. The traveling merchant who traded with you and your fellow guards.</p>\n<p>4. The leader of a group of interlopers who tried&mdash;perhaps successfully&mdash;to get past you to access the tomb.</p>\n<p>5. An intelligent monster that laired nearby your post and kept you company&mdash;or was a constant bother.</p>\n<p>6. The leader of the unit of tomb guards you served with.</p>\n<p>7. The annoying tomb robber you were constantly chasing off or catching.</p>\n<p>8. The security expert that helped you refine the tomb&rsquo;s defenses after a breach.</p>\n<p>9. The imprisoned entity you kept from escaping.</p>\n<p>10. The blacksmith who maintained your armor and weapons.</p>\n<h3><strong>Tomb Guardian Mementos</strong></h3>\n<p>1. Your ceremonial armor, a suit of scale mail decorated to match your uniform.</p>\n<p>2. A book of meditations you used to condition your mind for long shifts standing guard.</p>\n<p>3. A tattered old cloak you used to stay warm during chilly nights at your post.</p>\n<p>4. A ceremonial weapon.</p>\n<p>5. A letter containing news of an important event such as a wedding or a funeral you were not able to leave your post to attend.</p>\n<p>6. A backup dagger that was against regulations but you always had anyway.</p>\n<p>7. A massive, heavy key.</p>\n<p>8. A bullseye lantern you carried on your rounds.</p>\n<p>9. A set of written security directives.</p>\n<p>10. A trophy taken from a would-be tomb robber.</p>",
