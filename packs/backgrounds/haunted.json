You gain a +2 to your choice of your passive Perception, Investigation, or Insight score, depending on your spirit&rsquo;s skills.</p><p>If you banish, free, or otherwise lose your spirit, consult with the Narrator to choose an appropriate feature from another background. Alternatively, the Narrator may rule that you&rsquo;ve become a beacon for the supernatural and another spirit has taken up haunting you.</p><p><em><strong>Adventures and Advancement.</strong></em> Whether you seek to violently banish the restless dead or help them to peacefully pass on, you will gain a reputation as a spirit-speaker. Common folk and nobility alike are likely to approach you for advice and aid with everything from hereditary curses to irritable poltergeists to speaking with a dead relative about a lost treasure.</p><p>After you have solved several such problems, you&rsquo;ve become known to those who deal in certain kinds of esoteric knowledge and gain access to their private libraries. These vast personal collections contain esoteric mysteries, such as those answerable with a DC 25 Arcana, History, or Religion check. While using such a library your host will provide you and your companions a moderate or rich lifestyle, depending on their means and how impressed they are by your exploits.</p>",
