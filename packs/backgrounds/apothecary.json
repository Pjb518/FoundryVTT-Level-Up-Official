You might be a scholar of&nbsp;medicine (&ldquo;doctor&rdquo;), a medical alchemist, a nurse at a religious institution, a combat medic, or even a &ldquo;witch&rdquo; whose services are poorly understood. You might even be one who has turned their back on healing, using your medical knowledge to undermine mortal lives.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 52\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>What is your medical tradition, and who was your teacher? Does your role garner you the respect or ire of your community? Are you called to adventure by your&nbsp; compassion, dire circumstance, or the chance for glory?</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Apothecary&nbsp;Traits</h3>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 52\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increases:</strong> +1 to Wisdom and one other ability score.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Medicine, and either Insight, Nature, or Religion.</p>\n<p><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Herbalism kit, and either alchemist&rsquo;s supplies or poisoner&rsquo;s kit.</p>\n<p><strong>Suggested Equipment (Cost 47 gold):</strong> Traveler&rsquo;s clothes, healer&rsquo;s satchel (10 uses), herbalism kit, laudanum</p>\n<p><strong>Feature: Housecalls.</strong> When you wear the uniform of your office (such as a doctor&rsquo;s jacket, medic insignia, or a witch&rsquo;s hat), people familiar with your medical tradition recognize you as a member on sight,&nbsp;oftentimes making requests for your healing expertise. Strangers who trust your medical tradition and receive your care will support you with a modest lifestyle.</p>\n<p><strong>Adventures and Advancement.</strong> Oftentimes your clients' medical difficulties emerge from even deeper social and economic problems. An apothecary with power to make change is often quested to cure difficult illnesses and ameliorate dangerous life circumstances.</p>\n<p>After enough life-changing interventions, the people will request you to take on students. You gain the service of 4 apprentices (2 inexperiences healers and 2 inexperienced apothecaries), who serve you freely but do expect them you to train them.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
