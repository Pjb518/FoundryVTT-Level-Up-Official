		"description": "<p>A cottage garden is often a point of pride for those who tend to them. The artful blend and arrangement of perennial flowers and greenery, along with carefully-placed stepping stones, is indeed its own kind of art form. Whether you look after your own garden or tend to that of a wealthy individual, flowers and plants always seem to flourish in your care.</p>\n<p>Why have you been called away from your beloved garden on an adventure? Are you accompanying a friend or acquaintance as company on the road? Are you seeking the knowledge of druids? Or are you merely seeking a change of pace from your quaint life?</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increases: </strong>+1 to Strength and one other ability score.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Nature, and either Animal Handling or Athletics</p>\n<p><strong>Suggested Equipment (6 gold):</strong> Common clothes, fishing tackle, shovel, 5 Supply.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Feature: Eye for Herbs.</strong></em> Your time in the garden means you&rsquo;ve picked up on a thing or two when it comes to identifying useful plants (even if they&rsquo;re &ldquo;weeds&rdquo;). Whenever you succeed on the Harvest journey activity, you gather twice as many plants as you would normally.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Adventure and Advancement.</strong></em> The more time you spend out in the wilderness among wild plants, the more you start to learn about their beneficial properties. If you successfully harvest helpful plants enough times, you may use your harvest journey activity to produce two basic healing potions per week instead of just one.</p>\n<h3>Cottage Gardener Connections</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The toad who lives under the back step and sometimes speaks words of wisdom.</li>\n<li>Your neighbor, with whom you have a friendly&mdash;but intense&mdash;rivalry for best garden.</li>\n<li>The master gardener you learned your trade from.</li>\n<li>The ne&rsquo;er-do-well who dug up and stole your rosebush.</li>\n<li>The eccentric wizard who stopped by and left a gold ring on your sideboard.</li>\n<li>The little girl who always asks to pick, &ldquo;One daisy, please!&rdquo;</li>\n<li>The mayor of your local village, who always compliments your flowers.</li>\n<li>The florist who comes to you for your peonies&mdash;they&rsquo;re the best around.</li>\n<li>The rabbit who keeps eating your hostas.</li>\n<li>The kindly gentleman who always stops by for a chat.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Cottage Gardener Mementos</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>A small pouch of bird seed to feed the birds.</li>\n<li>Your trusty trowel that&rsquo;s always on your belt.</li>\n<li>A book of pressed flowers that you add to as you go.</li>\n<li>A note from your friend who went missing&mdash;something about a grand adventure?</li>\n<li>A packet of wildflower seeds from home.</li>\n<li>A sprig of dried rosemary, for luck.</li>\n<li>Your favorite pair of leather gloves.</li>\n<li>A mysterious bulb that you were gifted but could never get to sprout.</li>\n<li>Some of your favorite tea to drink in the garden.</li>\n<li>Your straw sun hat.</li>\n</ol>",
