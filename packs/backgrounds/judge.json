Judges are usually well-compensated and comfortable, but also tend to have to deal with a lot of liars and frequently have quite a few enemies.</p>\n<p>Were you a dedicated and impartial civil servant, or did you succumb to corruption? Were you harsh or lenient? Did you enjoy your work? Why did you leave the bench to become an adventurer?&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increases:</strong>&nbsp;+1 to Wisdom and one other ability score.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:&nbsp;</strong>Insight, and either Culture or History.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages:&nbsp;</strong>Two of your choice</p>\n<p><strong>Suggested Equipment (cost 32 gp):&nbsp;</strong>Fine clothes, robes, ink and inkpen, 5 sheets of paper, sealing wax, signet ring.</p>\n<p><strong>Feature: BS Detector.<em>&nbsp;</em></strong>In every society everywhere, those before a court will twist the truth in an attempt to obtain the result they want. Being subjected to that day in and day out has made you skeptical and practiced at penetrating lies. Whenever you make an Insight check to determine whether someone is being truthful with you, reroll any result of 1 on the d20.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Adventures and Advancement.&nbsp;</strong>As your career advances, so too may threats against you. If you perform your duties faithfully (whatever that means in your culture) you may eventually be provided with a security detail of up to 8&nbsp;<strong>guards</strong>.</p>",
