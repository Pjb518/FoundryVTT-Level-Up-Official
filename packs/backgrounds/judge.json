Why did you leave the bench to become an adventurer?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ability Score Increases:</strong>&nbsp;+1 to Wisdom and one other ability score.</p><p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:&nbsp;</strong>Insight, and either Culture or History.</p><p><strong>Languages:&nbsp;</strong>Two of your choice</p><p><strong>Suggested Equipment (cost 32 gp):&nbsp;</strong>Fine clothes, robes, ink and inkpen, 5 sheets of paper, sealing wax, signet ring.</p><p><strong>Feature: BS Detector.<em>&nbsp;</em></strong>In every society everywhere, those before a court will twist the truth in an attempt to obtain the result they want.
