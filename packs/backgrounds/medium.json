Roll a d6. On a result of 1&ndash;3, a spirit enters into your body and uses your mouth to speak. On a result of 4&ndash;6, nothing happens. The type of spirit that possesses you is determined by the Narrator.</p>\n<p>While possessed, one of your allies may ask a question of the spirit. This question must be easily answered in 25 words or less, as in the sending spell. While the spirit is compelled to answer, it is not required to answer clearly or truthfully. When the spirit has finished, it immediately leaves you. Once you have used this ability, you may not do so again until you complete a long rest.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Adventures and Advancement. </strong></em>When people learn that you have the ability to commune with spirits, they may approach you with local legends of haunted locales. If you successfully dispel a troublesome ghost or convince it to move on, you and your allies may be treated to a moderate lifestyle so long as you are within the town.</p>\n<h3>Medium Connections</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The grieving widow you seek to help</li>\n<li>A local child who claims to see the dead</li>\n<li>The person you conned into thinking they were speaking to their dead loved one</li>\n<li>The ghost of a childhood pet</li>\n<li>The local watchman who sometimes meets you in secret for help on a case</li>\n<li>A young person who wishes to become your apprentice</li>\n<li>The spirit of a lonely old man who just wants a friend</li>\n<li>The cemetery overseer who is stubbornly haunted by his former business partner</li>\n<li>The ghost you swear is always hiding your keys in the strangest places</li>\n<li>Whatever it is that gives you the persistent feeling of always being watched</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Medium Mementos</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The planchet to a broken spirit board</li>\n<li>A mourning ring</li>\n<li>A piece of obsidian for protection</li>\n<li>A small lock of hair</li>\n<li>A dried flower from a forgotten grave</li>\n<li>An elegy written on a piece of parchment</li>\n<li>A locket with a cameo portrait of a deceased loved one</li>\n<li>A brooch in the shape of a skull</li>\n<li>A vial of soil taken from a disturbed grave</li>\n<li>A small salt well</li>\n</ol>",
