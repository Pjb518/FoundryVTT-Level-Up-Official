		"description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">You used to be dead. Now you&rsquo;re not. Whether you have been brought back to life or returned as an undead, you have experienced the Other Side and are still around to tell the tale&mdash;if you remember it. You may be the product of a miracle, a tragedy, or an experiment, but it&rsquo;s unlikely that your existence could be called &ldquo;ordinary.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How did you die? Who or what brought you back? How long were you dead? How much of the afterlife do you remember? Which afterlife were you sent to? Do you appreciate your existence, or does it torment you? Are you afraid of dying again?</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Returned Traits</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Ability Score Increases:</strong> +1 to Constitution and one other ability score.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Religion, and either Arcana or History.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Languages: </strong>One of your choice</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Suggested Equipment (Cost 5 gold): </strong>Funerary clothes</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Feature: Seen the Other Side. </strong>You have journeyed beyond the veil of death and saw some unusual sights on your journey. Creatures of death or the afterlife such as Celestials, Fiends, and Undead can recognize this about you at a glance and will often be more forthcoming and candid with you than other mortals. If one would normally be hostile to you, there is also a 50% chance they will be indifferent instead. You do not gain this benefit with creatures you or your allies engage in combat.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-29a962b5-7fff-70c1-16ab-3ac112cf6a96\">Adventures and Advancement.</strong>&nbsp;As you adventure, you may wind up learning more about the relationship between life and death, and in so doing, may find how to attract the service of the messengers of mortality. You gain the free service of a raven familiar (per the find familiar spell) and 2 swarms of ravens. When a raven swarms dies, it is replaced after a long rest.</p>",
