With enough time spent in a library, you can uncover most of the answers you seek (any question answerable with a DC 20&nbsp;Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History, Nature, or Religion check).</p><p><strong><em>Adventures and Advancement</em></strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>When you visit libraries and universities you tend to be asked for help in your role as a comparatively rough-and-tumble adventurer. After fetching a few bits of esoteric knowledge and settling a few academic disputes, you may be granted access to the restricted areas of the library (which contain darker secrets and deeper mysteries, such as those answerable with a DC 25&nbsp;Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History, Nature, or Religion check).</p><h3><strong>SAGE CONNECTIONS</strong></h3><ol><li>Your rival who always seems to be one step ahead of you in the research race.</li><li>The college dean who banished you for conduct unbefitting a research fellow.</li><li>A former student of yours who has become a dangerous wizard.</li><li>The professor who took credit for your research.</li><li>The rival sage whose cruel nickname for you has made you a laughingstock.</li><li>The alchemist who will pay for bizarre monster trophies and other ingredients&mdash;no questions asked.</li><li>The peer with a competing cosmological theory that causes endless friendly bickering.</li><li>The noble who recognized your intelligence at a young age and sponsored your entrance into academia.</li><li>A talented apprentice who ran away after mastering magical power but not the theoretical foundation to control it.</li><li>The invading general who burned the library that was once your home.</li></ol><hr><h3><strong>SAGE MEMENTOS</strong></h3><ol><li>A letter from a colleague asking for research help.</li><li>Your incomplete manuscript.</li><li>An ancient scroll in a language that no magic can decipher.</li><li>A copy of your highly unorthodox theoretical work that got you in so much trouble.</li><li>A list of the forbidden books that may answer your equally forbidden question.</li><li>A formula for a legendary magic item for which you have no ingredients.</li><li>An ancient manuscript of a famous literary work believed to have been lost; only you believe that it is genuine.</li><li>Your mentor&rsquo;s incomplete bestiary, encyclopedia, or other work that you vowed to complete.</li><li>Your prize possession: a magic quill pen that takes dictation.</li><li>The name of a book you need for your research that seems to be missing from every library you&rsquo;ve visited.</li></ol>",
