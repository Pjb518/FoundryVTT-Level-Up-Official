Do you seek ancient wisdom? Power? The answer to a specific question? Reinstatement in your former institution?&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Ability Score Increases:</strong>&nbsp;+1 to Intelligence and one other ability score.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong>History, and either Arcana, Culture, Engineering, or Religion.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Languages:</strong>&nbsp;Two of your choice.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Suggested Equipment (Cost 16 gold):&nbsp;</strong>Bottle of ink, pen, 50 sheets of parchment, common clothes.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong><em>Feature: Library Privileges</em></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;As a fellow or friend of several universities you have visiting access to the great libraries, most of which are off-limits to the general public. With enough time spent in a library, you can uncover most of the answers you seek (any question answerable with a DC 20&nbsp;Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History, Nature, or Religion check).</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong><em>Adventures and Advancement</em></strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>When you visit libraries and universities you tend to be asked for help in your role as a comparatively rough-and-tumble adventurer. After fetching a few bits of esoteric knowledge and settling a few academic disputes, you may be granted access to the restricted areas of the library (which contain darker secrets and deeper mysteries, such as those answerable with a DC 25&nbsp;Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History, Nature, or Religion check).</p>\n<h3><strong>SAGE CONNECTIONS</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Your rival who always seems to be one step ahead of you in the research race.</li>\n<li>The college dean who banished you for conduct unbefitting a research fellow.</li>\n<li>A former student of yours who has become a dangerous wizard.</li>\n<li>The professor who took credit for your research.</li>\n<li>The rival sage whose cruel nickname for you has made you a laughingstock.</li>\n<li>The alchemist who will pay for bizarre monster trophies and other ingredients&mdash;no questions asked.</li>\n<li>The peer with a competing cosmological theory that causes endless friendly bickering.</li>\n<li>The noble who recognized your intelligence at a young age and sponsored your entrance into academia.</li>\n<li>A talented apprentice who ran away after mastering magical power but not the theoretical foundation to control it.</li>\n<li>The invading general who burned the library that was once your home.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h3><strong>SAGE MEMENTOS</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>A letter from a colleague asking for research help.</li>\n<li>Your incomplete manuscript.</li>\n<li>An ancient scroll in a language that no magic can decipher.</li>\n<li>A copy of your highly unorthodox theoretical work that got you in so much trouble.</li>\n<li>A list of the forbidden books that may answer your equally forbidden question.</li>\n<li>A formula for a legendary magic item for which you have no ingredients.</li>\n<li>An ancient manuscript of a famous literary work believed to have been lost; only you believe that it is genuine.</li>\n<li>Your mentor&rsquo;s incomplete bestiary, encyclopedia, or other work that you vowed to complete.</li>\n<li>Your prize possession: a magic quill pen that takes dictation.</li>\n<li>The name of a book you need for your research that seems to be missing from every library you&rsquo;ve visited.</li>\n</ol>",
