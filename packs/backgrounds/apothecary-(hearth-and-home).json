		"description": "<p>As an apothecary, you are often one of the first people someone calls when a loved one is ill or injured. In your hands, herbs and roots become tinctures, salves, and expectorants. And while most people seek you out for remedies and cures, your herbal and even chemical knowledge extends to other sundries as well, such as perfumes, soaps, and lotions.</p>\n<p>Why have you ventured forth from your apothecary doors? Are you conducting research, seeking a new formulation or cure? Are you seeking some ancient, long-lost formula that you want to recreate? Or are you looking to apply your expertise to other, more esoteric arts?</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increases:</strong> +1 to Intelligence and one other ability score.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies: </strong>Investigation and either Nature or Medicine</p>\n<p><strong>Toolkit Proficiencies: </strong>Alchemist&rsquo;s supplies</p>\n<p><strong>Suggested Equipment (Cost 14 gold): </strong>Traveler&rsquo;s clothes, backpack, 5 vials, 1 perfume vial</p>\n<p><em><strong>Feature: Something for Everything.</strong></em> It feels as if you have something for everything in your bag of curatives and sundry goods. Once per long rest, you may produce one instance of the following medicinals: dried yewclaw bark, fairy cap, ironwood acorn, or pressed spiderbulb.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Adventures and Advancement.</strong></em> Once people learn of your profession, they may approach you with requests for aid. If you cure their ailments, you and your companions may be treated to a modest lifestyle by way of thanks.</p>\n<h3>Apothecary Connections</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Your research partner or assistant who has inexplicably gone missing.</li>\n<li>The old man who comes to you for ointment for his old injuries.</li>\n<li>A traveling snake oil salesman who stole one of your formulas for themselves.</li>\n<li>The unusual young man who always has the most bizarre requests.</li>\n<li>The farmhand whose broken arm you set.</li>\n<li>A noble woman who meets you discreetly for her medicine.</li>\n<li>The strange lady who grows some of your more unusual herbs.</li>\n<li>The family of the child whose life you saved.</li>\n<li>The customer who always has trouble sleeping.</li>\n<li>The little girl who brings you sick or injured animals for help.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Apothecary Mementos</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>A soapstone mortar and pestle.</li>\n<li>Your battered and worn field guide to medicinal plants and mushrooms</li>\n<li>Your book of formulas and recipes.</li>\n<li>A curious liquid that you are currently researching the properties of.</li>\n<li>A package of blank labels just waiting for bottles or vials.</li>\n<li>An old leather satchel, handed down to you from the person who taught you the craft.</li>\n<li>A sachet of dried sage that you keep in your pocket at all times.</li>\n<li>Your favorite quill or fountain pen.</li>\n<li>A sample of what you believe to be an unidentified mushroom.</li>\n<li>A small card catalog of your current ingredient stores.</li>\n</ol>",
