		"description": "<p>You&rsquo;re an experienced mariner with a keen weather eye and a favorite tavern in every port. Hard voyages have toughened you and the sea&rsquo;s power has made you humble.</p>\n<p>Were you a deckhand, an officer, or the captain of your vessel? Did you crew a naval cutter, a fishing boat, a merchant&rsquo;s barge, a privateering vessel, or a pirate ship?&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Ability Score Increases:</strong>&nbsp;+1 to Constitution and one other ability score.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong>&nbsp;Athletics, and either Acrobatics or Perception.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong>&nbsp;Navigator&rsquo;s tools, water vehicles.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Suggested Equipment (Cost 27 gold):&nbsp;</strong>Common clothes, navigator&rsquo;s tools, 50 feet of rope.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong><em>Feature: Sea Salt.</em></strong>&nbsp;Your nautical jargon and rolling gait mark you unmistakably as a mariner. You can easily enter into shop talk with any sailors that are not hostile to you, learning nautical gossip and ships&rsquo; comings and goings. You also recognize most large ships by sight and by name, and can make a History or&nbsp;Culture&nbsp;check to recall their most recent captain and allegiance.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong><em>Adventures and Advancement.</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>You and your companions will be able to take passage for free on nearly any commercial ship in exchange for occasional ship duties when all hands are called. In addition, after you have a few naval exploits under your belt your fame makes sailors eager to sail under you. You can hire a ship&rsquo;s crew at half the usual price.</p>",
