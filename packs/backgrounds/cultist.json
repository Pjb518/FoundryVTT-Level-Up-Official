You performed ancient rites found in forbidden tomes, seeking to empower a fiend, a false god, or a terrible being from a strange and distant realm.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Why did you leave the cult? Did you come to recognize the emptiness of its promises of power? Did you witness horrors that shook your faith? Or do you still nurture its dark edicts in your heart?</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Ability Score Increases:</strong>&nbsp;+1 to Intelligence and one other ability score.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Skill Proficiencies:&nbsp;</strong>Religion, and either Arcana or Deception.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Languages:</strong>&nbsp;One of your choice.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Suggested Equipment (Cost 7 gold):</strong>&nbsp;Holy symbol&nbsp;(amulet or reliquary), common clothes, robes, 5 torches.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong><em>Feature: Forbidden Lore</em></strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>When you fail an Arcana or Religion check, you know what being or book holds the knowledge you seek&mdash;finding the book or paying the being&rsquo;s price is another matter.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong><em>Adventures and Advancement</em></strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Members of your former order may be hunting you for reenlistment, punishment, or both.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\">Additionally, your cult still seeks to open a portal, effect an apotheosis, or otherwise cause catastrophe. Eventually you may have to face the leader of your cult and perhaps even the being you once worshiped</p>",
