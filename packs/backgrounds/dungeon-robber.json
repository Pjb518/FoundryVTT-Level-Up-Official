		"description": "<p>You seek the treasures of empires long vanished. The world&rsquo;s dungeons are brimming with lost secrets and artifacts of unimaginable power&mdash;and they belong in a museum, or at least in your living room. While others call you a tomb robber, you consider yourself an archaeologist, a collector, or an explorer.</p><p>Are you associated with a wizards&rsquo; college or institute of higher learning, or are you a private collector? Are you an idealist or a profiteer? What is the one relic or piece of knowledge that you&rsquo;d trade anything to find?</p><p><strong>Ability Score Increases:</strong> +1 to Intelligence and one other ability score.</p><p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> History, and either Investigation or Religion.</p><p><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Cartographers&rsquo; tools.</p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> Any six (three of them no longer spoken).</p><p><strong>Suggested Equipment (Cost 18 gold):</strong> Cartographers&rsquo; tools, miner&rsquo;s pick, traveler&rsquo;s clothes, shovel.</p><p><em><strong>Feature: Unreliable Intelligence.</strong></em> You know conspiracy theorists, armchair historians, disgraced academics, and other people with useful, if unreliable, knowledge. While in a city, once per day you can find an NPC who can make an Intelligence check with a +10 bonus to recall a fact. When you do so, the Narrator secretly rolls a d6. On a 1, your contact&rsquo;s information is dangerously inaccurate.</p><p><em><strong>Adventures and Advancement:</strong></em> As you build your reputation, shady people approach you with requests to &ldquo;discover&rdquo; items of uncertain ownership. After enough successes, a legitimate organization, such as a wizard&rsquo;s college or esteemed museum, takes an interest in you. They offer you a position, which comes with funding granting a Wealthy lifestyle, access to free spellcasting services, and legal representation when you inevitably run afoul of the law.</p><h3><strong>DUNGEON ROBBER CONNECTIONS</strong></h3><p>1. A rival who always tries to steal what you rightfully find.</p><p>2. A rival who seeks powerful artifacts for evil ends.</p><p>3. A fence who can find a buyer for anything.</p><p>4. An underworld figure to whom you owe a staggering debt.</p><p>5. A master forger who can replicate plausible records of ownership, permissions to restricted areas, and so on.</p><p>6. An artist who can make perfect copies of artwork and paintings.</p><p>7. A collector who sends you after valuable curios.</p><p>8. Authorities who would like to question you about a relic&rsquo;s mysterious disappearance.</p><p>9. An admiring urchin who can get you anywhere in their city.</p><p>10. A rambling sage whose bizarre, shocking theories you half believe.</p><h3><strong>DUNGEON ROBBER MEMENTOS</strong></h3><p>1. A mysterious idol whose origin you seek.</p><p>2. A cultural item from Chapter 1: Equipment</p><p>3. A treasure map with no obvious connection to any known land mass.</p><p>4. An ancient piece of machinery that is undoubtedly very powerful, although all it currently does is light up.</p><p>5. A rare book that grants an expertise die on checks related to a specific civilization.</p><p>6. A gold coin bearing the face of a king who never existed.</p><p>7. Identification papers from the institution that has kicked you out.</p><p>8. A tablet carved with indecipherable glyphs.</p><p>9. A giant-sized key to an unknown door.</p><p>10. One piece of a seven-part artifact.</p>",
