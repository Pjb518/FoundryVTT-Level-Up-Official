		"description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">You are a covert operative. Spies serve in a wide variety of circumstances and use whatever means are most expedient to acquire intelligence while remaining undetected. You might be the product of an elite program that produces world-class espionage operatives, or you could be a self-trained member of an extensive grass-roots resistance movement.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Spies vary in terms of employer, social location, method, and training. Are you part of an organization, or a freelancer? Do you follow a cause or work for money? How did you come by your skills, and who, if anyone, taught you? What social circles do you run in to get the information you seek?&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Spy Traits</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Ability Score Increases: </strong>+1 to Wisdom and one other ability score.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Stealth, and either Deception or Investigation.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Thieves&rsquo; Tools, and either the Disguise Kit or the Forgery Kit.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Suggested Equipment (Cost 30 gold): </strong>Traveler&rsquo;s clothes, thieves&rsquo; tools, dagger, caltrops</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Feature: Socially Invisible. </strong>You have mastered the art of blending in. When you are in a crowded environment, as long as you don&rsquo;t do anything noteworthy&mdash;such as drawing attention to yourself or overtly commiting a crime&mdash;people generally ignore you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-946477f6-7fff-1702-7395-9925473ddef2\">Adventures and Advancement. </strong>If you accomplish a number of missions successfully, you may rise in the ranks of your organization or find yourself able to command higher rates for your services. You also can bring in specialists as needed. You gain the services of a free follower of a type of your choosing.<strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-946477f6-7fff-1702-7395-9925473ddef2\"> </strong></p>",
