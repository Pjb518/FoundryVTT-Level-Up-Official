		"description": "<p>For some, bees represent something to be feared, but you delight in the sound of their industrious buzzing because it heralds one thing: honey. You dote on your hives, making sure that the bees in your care are happy and healthy, and in exchange you harvest the excess honey that they produce. As the local beekeeper, you are often somewhat of a community fixture, providing your neighbors with honey and beeswax.</p>\n<p>Why did you choose to leave your home and your hives? Are you seeking new, exotic flowers to introduce to your garden to produce a new flavor of honey? Or did some terrible malady befall your hives, forcing you to seek out a cure for the future?</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increases:</strong> +1 to Dexterity and one other ability score.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Animal Handling and either Medicine or Nature</p>\n<p><strong>Suggested Equipment (Cost 15 gold):</strong> Common clothes, 5 Supply, backpack, 6 candles, flint and steel.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Feature: Helping Hand. </strong></em>Bees work together and teamwork is one of the many things they taught you. Once per long rest, when an ally that you can see attempts a check with a skill that you are proficient in, they may add an expertise die to the roll.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Adventure and Advancement.</strong></em> When locals discover that you are a beekeeper, they may approach you for help with local swarms or provide you with information on where to find them. Eventually, you attract the attention of two Giant Bees that serve as your followers. These bees use the statistics of a Giant Wasp.</p>\n<h3>Apiarist Connections</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The local candlemaker who comes to you for beeswax.</li>\n<li>An overly inquisitive bee from one of your hives.
