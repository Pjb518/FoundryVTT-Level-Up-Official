		"description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Enforcers, mercenaries, and &ldquo;private contractors.&rdquo; When the people of means (legal authorities, aristocrafts, and crime bosses) are unable to reach their offenders, they hire out these needs to people such as yourself who aren&rsquo;t afraid to get their hands a little dirty while on the hunt. No doubt, most adventurers could call themselves bounty hunters, but few adventurers dedicated their previous lives to this profession&mdash;which to the surprise of many does have certain standards of behavior. After all, you don&rsquo;t bring people kicking-and-screaming to the feet of the law (or whomever) out of your sense of charity.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What draws you to this unsavory line of work? Maybe you have tough skin, allowing you to think of this as &ldquo;just a job.&rdquo; Do you represent the scum and villainy whose true joy is dominating your captives? Or maybe people consider you a pillar of the community for ousting said scum and villainy. In your line of work, there is no way to please everyone&mdash;so who considers you the bad guy?</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Bounty Hunter Traits</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Ability Score Increases: </strong>+1 to Strength and one other ability score.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Intimidation, and either Deception, Insight, Investigation, or Stealth.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One gaming set (any), plus either thieves&rsquo; tools or poisoner's kit.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Language Proficiencies:</strong> One of your choice&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Suggested Equipment (Cost 30 gold):</strong> Traveler&rsquo;s clothes, dark cloak, thieves&rsquo; tools, net, hemp rope (50 feet), a club pierced by a dozen sharp nails (deals piercing damage).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Feature: Bounty Boards.</strong> You know the common procedures for finding information on wanted people. When you are in a community such as a settlement or a district of a large city, you can spend 1 hour gathering leads on bounties. You learn about one of the following: a villainous threat to this community, a wanted small-time criminal, the identity of a local crime group, a noble looking for &ldquo;a trustworthy employee,&rdquo; or a commoner wronged by any of these. You can express which you prefer, but the information you find is determined by the Narrator. Whatever person or group you learn about, you get a lead on their location and some assurance of payment for your work.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-877d78af-7fff-e41b-e3b3-d611c356a907\">Adventures and Advancement. </strong>Consistent, clean bounty collection may capture the attention of a generous employer&hellip; It can also cause factions you cross to put a bounty on&nbsp; your head! If you silence your rivals and those who would retaliate against you, you might just find yourself in a position of power&mdash;the right-hand of a noble, politician, or criminal.</p>",
