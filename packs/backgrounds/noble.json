If you advance your family&rsquo;s fortunes, you may earn a knighthood along with the free service of a retinue of servants and up to 8&nbsp;guards.</p><h3><strong>NOBLE CONNECTIONS</strong></h3><ol><li>Your perfect elder sibling to whom you never seem to measure up.</li><li>The treacherous noble who slaughtered or scattered your family and is now living in your ancestral home.</li><li>Your family servant, a retired adventurer who taught you more about battle than any fancy dueling master.</li><li>The foppish friend you carouse with.</li><li>The common-born sweetheart that your family forbid you from seeing again.</li><li>The fugitive head of your family whose rebellion caused your family&rsquo;s lands to be seized and titles to be redistributed.</li><li>Your foe, the heir of a rival house, with whom you have dueled twice.</li><li>The crime boss to whom your family is in massive debt.</li><li>The scion of an allied family to whom you were betrothed from birth.</li><li>The eccentric knight for whom you trained as a squire or page.</li></ol><hr><h3><strong>NOBLE MEMENTOS</strong></h3><ol><li>A shield or tabard bearing your coat of arms.</li><li>A keepsake or love letter from a high-born sweetheart.</li><li>An heirloom weapon&mdash;though it&rsquo;s not magical, it has a name and was used for mighty deeds.</li><li>A letter of recommendation to a royal court.</li><li>Perfumed handkerchiefs suitable for blocking the smell of commoners.</li><li>An extremely fashionable and excessively large hat.</li><li>A visible scar earned in battle or in a duel.</li><li>A set of common clothes and a secret commoner identity.</li><li>IOUs of dubious value that were earned in games of chance against other nobles.</li><li>A letter from a friend begging for help.</li></ol>",
