Since you&rsquo;re taking up a life of adventuring, it&rsquo;s quite likely that you&rsquo;re a second child or more distant heir with no vast inheritance to look forward to. You&rsquo;ve got to make your own way in the world with only your years of training from armsmasters and private tutors, your many rich relatives and friends, and your not inconsiderable personal wealth.</p>\n<p>How rich and powerful is your noble family? Will the titled head of the family help you out of trouble? What is your family&rsquo;s coat of arms or heraldic symbol?</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Ability Score Increases:</strong>&nbsp;+1 to Strength and one other ability score.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Skill Proficiencies:&nbsp;</strong>Culture, History, and either Animal Handling or Persuasion.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong>&nbsp;One gaming set.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Languages:</strong>&nbsp;One of your choice.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Suggested Equipment (Cost 16 gold):</strong> Fine clothes, signet ring, writ detailing your family tree.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong><em>Feature: High Society</em></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;You know of&mdash;or personally know&mdash;most of the noble families for hundreds of miles. In most settled areas you (and possibly your companions, if well-behaved) can find a noble host who will feed you, shelter you, and offer you a rich lifestyle.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong><em>Adventures and Advancement</em></strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Your family may ask you for one or two little favors: convince this relative to marry a family-approved spouse, slay that family foe in a duel, serve under a liege lord in a battle. If you advance your family&rsquo;s fortunes, you may earn a knighthood along with the free service of a retinue of servants and up to 8&nbsp;<span class=\"freelinking-link\">guards</span>&nbsp;.</p>",
