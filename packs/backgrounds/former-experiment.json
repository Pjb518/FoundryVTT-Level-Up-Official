Your time being experimented on gave you a sense for what various strange things can do. You gain an expertise die on checks to identify unknown substances or devices and their purpose or effects (without using them).

If you contribute to enough beneficial research and/or stop enough dangerous research, you may gain an assistant to aid you, gaining the services of an inexperienced follower of the Apothecary, Diviner, Healer, or Sage types.</p>\n<h3>Former Experiment Connections</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The wizard or alchemist who experimented on you against your will, causing you untold suffering.</li>\n<li>The doctor, priest, or apothecary that used an experimental treatment on you, curing what was previously thought to be an incurable ailment or curse.</li>\n<li>The slaver who sold you into involuntary experimentation.</li>\n<li>Another experimental subject that you escaped alongside.</li>\n<li>Another experimental subject that you had to leave behind.</li>\n<li>The research assistant who made your period of experimentation bearable through small acts of kindness.</li>\n<li>The wizard or artificer that created you from raw materials.</li>\n<li>The spellcaster who raised you from the dead, reanimated you, or summoned you</li>\n<li>The leader of the angry mob who almost destroyed you.</li>\n<li>The ordinary person who became your first friend after you left.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Former Experiment Mementos</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The restraints you were held in place with, now broken.</li>\n<li>Cryptic, encoded notes about the experiments that were done on you.</li>\n<li>An unnatural physical feature that was a side effect of the experiments.</li>\n<li>A vial of a strange, swirling liquid of unknown provenance and properties.</li>\n<li>A set of surgical implements.</li>\n<li>A mysterious device that you haven&rsquo;t figured out the purpose of.</li>\n<li>A letter of release from the institution you were held in.</li>\n<li>A file detailing your history prior to being experimented on.</li>\n<li>A dried flower from where the experiments took place.</li>\n<li>A pristine uniform from the facility you were held in, just in case.</li>\n</ol>",
