		"description": "<p>This golden candlestick is sentient but will only light&nbsp;when held by someone it is friendly with&mdash;perhaps&nbsp;that someone is you. Whether or not the candlestick&nbsp;will accept you as an ally is at the Narrator&rsquo;s&nbsp;discretion, though it is highly recommended to&nbsp;keep it well-polished and speak to it once per day to&nbsp;encourage a long-lasting friendship. Once you have&nbsp;befriended the candlestick you are able to attune to it.</p>\n<p>While you are attuned to the candlestick, you can use a bonus action to politely ask it to light itself or extinguish its flame. If another force extinguishes its flame, the candlestick relights itself at the start of your next turn unless told otherwise.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Hydrophobic.</strong></em> The candlestick does not like&nbsp;exposure to water or having its candle replaced,&nbsp;and when either occurs it stops functioning for&nbsp;you until you make a DC 14 Persuasion check&nbsp;to earn its forgiveness.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Sentience.</strong></em> The candlestick is a sentient&nbsp;construct with Intelligence 14, Wisdom 10, and&nbsp;Charisma 18. It has hearing and darkvision to&nbsp;a range of 120 feet. The candlestick communicates&nbsp;with you telepathically and can speak and&nbsp;understand Common, Dwarvish, Elvish, and&nbsp;Halfling. It cannot read (or perhaps it is simply&nbsp;disinterested in doing so).</p>\n<p><em><strong>Personality.</strong></em> The candlestick&rsquo;s purpose is to&nbsp;provide ample lighting for its wielder and snuff&nbsp;itself out should the cover of darkness be required.&nbsp;It is sympathetic to those in need of assistance but&nbsp;demands to be treated with a certain amount of&nbsp;respect and appreciation for its service.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Destroying the Candlestick.</strong></em> When reduced to 0 hit points, the candlestick pours its remaining heart and soul into creating one last burst of flames before becoming a mundane item. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the candlestick must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>",
