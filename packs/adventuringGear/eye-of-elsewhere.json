		"description": "<p>This gray stone orb is carved into the likeness and&nbsp;size of a disquietingly realistic human eye with a&nbsp;ruby iris. Once you have attuned to it you can use&nbsp;an action to set the eye in a gentle orbit around your&nbsp;head, 1d4 feet away from you. Another creature may&nbsp;use an action to try and take an orbiting eye, but&nbsp;must make a melee attack against AC 24 or make a&nbsp;DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The eye&rsquo;s AC is&nbsp;24, it has 30 hit points, and resistance to all damage.&nbsp;While orbiting your head, it is considered a worn&nbsp;item. You can use an action to seize and stow the&nbsp;eye, returning it to an inert and inactive state.</p>\n<p>While the eye is actively orbiting your head, your Intelligence score increases by 2 (to a maximum of 22), you gain an expertise die on Intelligence checks and Perception checks, and you cannot be surprised or blinded.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Innate Arcane Eye.</strong></em> While the eye orbits your&nbsp;head, you know and can innately cast @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-spells.Item.1sp8qzuofkjmunsd]{Arcane Eye} without expending a spell slot or the need for&nbsp;material components.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Shared Paranoia.</strong></em> After you have attuned to&nbsp;the eye and it has been and active for 24 hours,&nbsp;you develop a paranoia that persists as long as it&nbsp;remains active. While paranoid you have disadvantage&nbsp;on Insight checks and you are considered&nbsp;roughing it if you sleep in the same room or tent&nbsp;as another humanoid creature.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Sentience.</strong></em> The eye is a sentient construct with&nbsp;Intelligence 20, Wisdom 15, and Charisma 8. It&nbsp;cannot hear, but has blindsight and darkvision to&nbsp;a range of 60 feet. The eye communicates with&nbsp;you and other creatures within 60 feet telepathically&nbsp;and can read, speak, and understand Abyssal,&nbsp;Common, Deep Speech, and Undercommon.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Personality.</strong></em> The eye of elsewhere contains&nbsp;the soul of something utterly alien to humanoid&nbsp;perceptions, betrayed and plunged into a&nbsp;constrained form. It is constantly paranoid and convinced that some worse fate could befall it at&nbsp;any moment. Once attuned it will try to learn&nbsp;everything and anything you know, especially&nbsp;secrets. If you are forthcoming with information&nbsp;the eye grows to trust you, but can be brought&nbsp;into conflict if you withhold any information.&nbsp;When in conflict the eye shuts and you no longer&nbsp;gain any of the eye&rsquo;s benefits or properties except&nbsp;for Shared Paranoia. The eye only opens again if&nbsp;you divulge an important secret or the information&nbsp;initially withheld.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Destroying the Eye.</strong></em> The eye is unbreakable but&nbsp;it has the power to implode and disintegrate itself.&nbsp;Success on a DC 28 Deception check convinces&nbsp;the eye that some horrifying and frightening&nbsp;threat is inevitably soon to befall it. Rather than&nbsp;accept its fate, the eye destroys itself and blinks&nbsp;out of existence. On a failed check, the creature&nbsp;permanently loses the eye&rsquo;s trust and the eye&nbsp;will never attune to it or be convinced by its&nbsp;Deception checks.</p>",
