Roll d100 on the <em>Wand of Wonder</em> table to determine the effect. Spells cast from the wand have a spell save DC of 15 and a range of 120 feet. Area effects are centered on and include the target. If an effect might target multiple creatures, the Narrator randomly determines which ones are affected.</p><p>This wand has 7 charges and regains [[/r 1d6+1]] expended charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a [[/r 1d20]]. On a 1, the wand violently shakes and sparks with magic then disappears</p><p><strong>[[/r 1d00]] Effect</strong></p><p><strong>01–05</strong> You cast @Compendium[a5e.a5e-spells.8ntarok16ox36ka2]{Slow}.<br><strong>06–10</strong> You cast @Compendium[a5e.a5e-spells.cvjsf5lssd7cbwq3]{Faerie Fire}.<br><strong>11–15</strong> You are awestruck and become stunned until the start of your next turn.<br><strong>16–20</strong> You cast @Compendium[a5e.a5e-spells.7cmrvukn7wmgc1pz]{Gust of Wind}.<br><strong>21–25</strong> You cast @Compendium[a5e.a5e-spells.5jvtflip9fm94w92]{Detect Thoughts} on the target. If you didn’t target a creature, you take [[/r 1d6 #psychic]] psychic damage instead.<br><strong>26–30</strong> You cast @Compendium[a5e.a5e-spells.zb5tuvq91hnclms6]{Stinking Cloud}.<br><strong>31–33</strong> Rain falls in a 60-foot radius centered on the target, making the area lightly obscured until the start of your next turn.<br><strong>34–36</strong> A beast appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to the target. You don’t control the animal, which acts as it normally would. Roll a [[/r 1d4]] to determine the beast (1: @Compendium[a5e.a5e-monsters.y7hpwm7mgalvohlh]{Rhinoceros}, 2: @Compendium[a5e.a5e-monsters.6xqz1sult1m6o3i1]{Elephant}, 3–4: @Compendium[a5e.a5e-monsters.nfqfofpcjvmowlym]{Rat}). <br><strong>37–46</strong> You cast @Compendium[a5e.a5e-spells.k72653sury5yomzn]{Lightning Bolt}.<br><strong>47–49</strong> Butterflies fill a 30-foot radius centered on the target, making the area heavily obscured. The butterflies remain for 10 minutes.<br><strong>50–53</strong> The target doubles in size (as if you had cast @Compendium[a5e.a5e-spells.90g1hadytrl4aydr]{Enlarge/Reduce}), or if the target is an attended object, you become the spell’s target.<br><strong>54–58</strong> You cast @Compendium[a5e.a5e-spells.u6qqufa6dcgnlaty]{Darkness}.<br><strong>59–62</strong> Grass grows on the ground in a 60-foot radius centered on the target. Existing grass grows to 10 times normal size for 1 minute, becoming difficult terrain.<br><strong>63–65</strong> An unattended object (chosen by the Narrator) within 120 feet of the target disappears into the Ethereal Plane. The object must be able to fit in a 10-foot cube.<br><strong>66–69</strong> You shrink to half your size (as @Compendium[a5e.a5e-spells.90g1hadytrl4aydr]{Enlarge/Reduce}).<br><strong>70–79</strong> You cast @Compendium[a5e.a5e-spells.47oifxu4ytkf7alt]{Fireball}.<br><strong>80–84</strong> You cast @Compendium[a5e.a5e-spells.4d7jmwuvmov14276]{Invisibility} on yourself.<br><strong>85–87</strong> Leaves grow from the target. If you targeted a point in space, leaves sprout from the creature nearest that point instead. The leaves fall off after 24 hours but can be pruned before that time.<br><strong>88–90</strong> A stream of [[/r 1d4x10 #gems]] gems (each worth 1 gp) shoots from the wand in a 30-foot long, 5-foot wide line. Each gem deals 1 bludgeoning damage. Divide the total damage equally among all creatures in the area.<br><strong>91–95</strong> A burst of shimmering light extends from you in a 30-foot radius. You and each creature in the area that can see make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br><strong>96–97</strong> For the next 1d10 days, the target is able to breathe underwater and its skin turns blue. If you targeted an object or point in space, the creature nearest that target is affected instead.<br><strong>98–100</strong> If you targeted a creature, it makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If you didn’t target a creature, you become the target in stead. A creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more is instantly petrified. On any other failed save, the creature is restrained and begins to turn to stone. While restrained in this way, the target repeats the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. A greater restoration spell or similar magic restores a petrified creature but the effect is otherwise permanent.</p>",
