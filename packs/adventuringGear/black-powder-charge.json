		"description": "<p>A pound of black powder inside a wooden shell with a fuse can make a simple but potent explosive. You can use an action to set and light one or more black powder charges which explode at the beginning of your next turn. Any creatures or objects within 10 feet of the exploding charge must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d6 force damage and 1d6 fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. Increase the explosion’s damage by 1d6 force and 1d6 fire for each doubling of the number of charges set beyond the first. For example, 4 black powder charges deal 3d6 force and 3d6 fire damage, 8 black powder charges deal 4d6 force and 4d6 fire damage, 32 black powder charges deal 6d6 force damage and 6d6 fire damage, and so on.</p><p>For each charge beyond the first, the area increases as follows: 2 charges—20-foot radius, 4 charges—30-foot radius, 8 charges—40-foot radius, 16 charges—50-foot radius, 32 charges— 60-foot radius. Black powder charges become useless and are destroyed when submerged in water or left exposed to rain.</p>",
