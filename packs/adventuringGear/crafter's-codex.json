    "description": "<p>Centuries ago, a famed artificer published her masterwork&nbsp;treatise on crafting magic items&mdash;humbly titled&nbsp;Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things&mdash;and the work&nbsp;was so revolutionary that every serious library simply&nbsp;had to have a copy. The work still influences the art&nbsp;of crafting magic items to this day.</p>\n<p>A regular copy of Wands, Rings, and Wondrous&nbsp;Things is a masterwork book (see page 332 in the&nbsp;Adventurer&rsquo;s Guide) about crafting magic items. Yet&nbsp;a fabled version of this tome is said to meander&nbsp;through literary circles&mdash;a copy annotated by a mad&nbsp;genius. Known as the Crafter&rsquo;s Codex, this copy of&nbsp;the book is dog-eared throughout and stuffed to the&nbsp;brim with exceedingly peculiar, illegible marginalia.&nbsp;To the person approaching the book through the&nbsp;right means (such as refracting the text through a&nbsp;beer glass, reading at strange angles, or using one&rsquo;s&nbsp;own personal genius) these notes reveal step-by-step&nbsp;instructions which streamline and improve the&nbsp;enchantments described within. Alas, no owner&nbsp;seems to hold on to the Crafter&rsquo;s Codex for long. The&nbsp;book itself appears to hyperfixate on a given reader&nbsp;and then simply disappear, presumably in search of&nbsp;someone more suited to its talents and disposition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Legends and Lore</h2>\n<p>Success on an Arcana or History check reveals&nbsp;the following:</p>\n<p><strong>DC 15</strong> This is the Crafter&rsquo;s Codex, a legendary book containing secrets of crafting magical items that can unsettle even the strongest minds.</p>\n<p><strong>DC 18</strong> This book is a unique annotated version of the more common Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things.</p>\n<p><strong>DC 21</strong> The Crafter&rsquo;s Codex can only be destroyed by destroying every copy of Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things that exists in the multiverse.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Artifact Properties</h2>\n<p>The Crafter&rsquo;s Codex has one lesser artifact benefit,&nbsp;one greater artifact benefit, and one greater artifact&nbsp;detriment. While attuned to this book, you gain&nbsp;an expertise die on any checks related to crafting a&nbsp;magic item, and you do not need to meet any of the&nbsp;usual requirements related to crafting a magic item&nbsp;aside from its cost.</p>\n<p>In addition, you gain one random long-term mental stress effect oriented around inventing, the Crafter&rsquo;s Codex, or keeping the book safely in your possession.</p>\n<p>Once between long rests, while crafting a magic item or performing an attendant activity towards crafting a magic item, you can consult the Crafter&rsquo;s Codex and make a DC 20 Intelligence check. On a&nbsp;success, choose one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce research time by 75%.</li>\n<li>Reduce component cost by 75%.</li>\n<li>Reduce crafting time by 75%.</li>\n<li>Reduce a harvesting DC by 6.</li>\n<li>Reduce a crafting DC by 6.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After three failures on the Intelligence check, the Crafter&rsquo;s Codex moves on. You retain a copy of Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things but the magic and marginalia of the Crafter&rsquo;s Codex magically transmits to a different copy somewhere else in the world, and you lose your attunement to it. Any bonuses accrued remain for the duration of the current crafting project or after a year and one day (whichever comes first).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Seekers of the Codex</h2>\n<p>The Crafter&rsquo;s Codex is coveted by collectors and&nbsp;ambitious artificers alike, and any search for the&nbsp;Crafter&rsquo;s Codex surely means encountering some&nbsp;of the following foes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Destruction</h2>\n<p>The secret knowledge that permeates the Crafter&rsquo;s&nbsp;Codex cannot simply be stricken from the world&nbsp;with ink, blade, or fire. When the artifact faces&nbsp;a serious physical threat it simply moves on. The only way to rid the world of the Crafter&rsquo;s Codex is&nbsp;to eliminate every last copy of Wands, Rings, and&nbsp;Wondrous Things that exists in the multiverse&mdash;if&nbsp;even one copy remains, even on another plane of&nbsp;existence, the Crafter&rsquo;s Codex persists.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>SEEKERS OF THE CODEX</strong></p>\n<table style=\"width: 100%; height: 117.578px;\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 6.87777%;\"><col style=\"width: 93.1222%;\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\"><strong>1D6</strong></td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\"><strong>ADVERSARY</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">Noble with entourage of bodyguards&mdash;previous&nbsp;owner or antimagic zealot</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">Assassin, stealthy mage, or thief</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">3</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">Rival artificer (friendly or hostile)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">4</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">Mischievous book-obsessed fey</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">5</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">Celestial or fiendish curator of an interplanar&nbsp;library</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">6</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16.7969px;\">Rival artificer from an entirely different&nbsp;Material Plane</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
