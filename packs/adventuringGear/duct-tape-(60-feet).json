		"description": "<p>This heavy-duty, airtight, water-resistant tape has a multitude of uses. You can use 3 feet for emergency repairs to clothing, containers, mechanical creatures, or armor, removing the broken condition for [[/r 1d8]] days. However, if the user suffers a critical hit before the item can be properly repaired, or something else would impose the broken condition on the item, the item re-breaks and cannot be repaired with duct tape again until properly repaired. You can also use 6 feet of the tape and an action to restrain a medium-sized creature (as zip cuffs), 1 foot to blind a restrained creature until an action is spent to remove the tape, and 1 foot to render a restrained creature unable to speak until an action is spent to remove the tape. A restrained creatureâ€™s airway can also be covered with 1 foot of the tape, causing it to begin suffocating until an action is spent to remove the tape. You can use 12 feet of the tape to secure a restrained creature to a chair or other stationary object, imposing disadvantage on checks to escape its restraints.</p>",
