Doing so requires a public space with at least 10 people, or an official gig at an establishment with a musical venue like a tavern or club. In either case make a check using your instrument for each hour you spend performing and consult Table: Performance Outcomes to determine the amount of gold you receive, though you may receive more or less than that at specific musical venues at the Narrator’s discretion. Bards can also use musical instruments as a spellcasting focus. Each type of musical instrument requires a separate proficiency.</p><p>TABLE: PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES</p><p>PERFORMANCE CHECK RESULTS</p><p>1–5     Banned from venue</p><p>6–14    1d4 cp</p><p>15–19  1d4 sp</p><p>20–24  1d4 gp</p><p>25+       3d4 gp</p>",
