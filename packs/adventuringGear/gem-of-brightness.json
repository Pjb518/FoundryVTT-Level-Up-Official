The creature makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or becomes blinded for 1 minute.</p><p>The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p></li><li><p><strong>5 charges</strong>: The third command word requires an action, causing the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or becomes blinded for 1 minute.</p><p>A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p></li></ul><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p>This prism has 50 charges. When all of the gem’s charges are expended it loses all magical properties, becoming a mundane jewel worth 50 gold.</p>",
