		"description": "<p>These small, palm-sized figurines of various animals run the entire gamut of artistic skill—some sculpted down to the last hair of detail and some looking more like the product of carvings by a drunkard.</p><p>The specifics of these figurines vary but they all work in essentially the same way: if you use an action to speak the appropriate command word and throw the figurine at a point within 60 feet, it transforms into a living creature the color of its original material. If the chosen space is occupied (either by creatures or non-living obstacles) the figurine does not transform.</p><p>It understands any language you can speak and follows your verbal commands. When not carrying out a task, the creature defends itself but does not otherwise act.</p><p>Each creature stays transformed for a specific duration, detailed in its individual entry. At the end of this duration, the creature turns back to its inanimate form. It also reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word while touching it. Once it has reverted to its figurine form, it cannot transform again for a specific length of time.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p>These statuettes are always created in threes, but are with different colors, poses, and abilities—most commonly a white goat running, a red goat standing, and a black goat rampant.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><ul><li><p><strong>Goat of Travel</strong>. The goat of travel has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge.</p><p>When the charges run out it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed, at which point it regains all charges.</p><p>This goat takes the form of a giant goat, but uses the statistics of a riding horse.</p></li><li><p><strong>Goat of Travail</strong>. The goat of travail becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours, after which it can’t be used again for 30 days.</p></li><li><p><strong>Goat of Terror</strong>. The goat of terror becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can’t attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons.</p><p>One horn becomes a +1 lance, and the other becomes a +2 longsword.</p><p>Removing a horn requires an action and the weapons disappear when the goat reverts to figurine form.</p><p>In addition, the goat radiates terror in a 30-foot radius while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the area makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or becomes frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form.</p><p>The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat’s terror for the next 24 hours.</p></li></ul><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p>After this figurine has been used, it can’t be used again until 15 days have passed.</p><blockquote><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>GOAT OF TRAVEL</strong> (CHALLENGE 1/4)</p><p>LARGE BEAST (50 XP)</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 10</p><p><strong>Hit Points</strong>: 19 (3d10+3; bloodied 9)</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>: 60 ft.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>STR — DEX — CON — INT — WIS — CHA</strong></p><p><strong>16 </strong>(+3) <strong>12 </strong>(+1) <strong>12 </strong>(+1) <strong>2 </strong>(–4) <strong>10 </strong>(+0) 6<strong> </strong>(–2)</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Proficiency</strong>:<strong> </strong>+2; <strong>Maneuver DC</strong>: 13</p><p><strong>Senses</strong>: passive Perception 10</p><p><strong>Languages</strong>: —</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><em>ACTIONS</em></p><p><strong>Hooves<em>.</em></strong><em> Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 4 (1d6+1) bludgeoning damage</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>GIANT GOAT</strong> (CHALLENGE 1/2)</p><p>LARGE BEAST (100 XP)</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 11 (natural armor)</p><p><strong>Hit Points</strong>: 22 (3d10+6; bloodied 11)</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>: 40 ft.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>STR — DEX — CON — INT — WIS — CHA</strong></p><p><strong>16 </strong>(+3) <strong>10 </strong>(+0) <strong>14 </strong>(+2) <strong>3 </strong>(–4) <strong>12 </strong>(+1) <strong>6 </strong>(–2)</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Proficiency</strong>:<strong> </strong>+2; <strong>Maneuver DC</strong>: 12</p><p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> STR +5</p><p><strong>Senses</strong>: passive Perception 11</p><p><strong>Languages</strong>: —</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><em>ACTIONS</em></p><p><strong>Ram<em>.</em></strong><em> Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (2d4+3) bludgeoning damage.
