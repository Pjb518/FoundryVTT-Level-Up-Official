		"description": "<p>While not in use, this item appears as a cloth the&nbsp;color of darkness. When unfolded, it opens up into&nbsp;a circular sheet that is 6 feet in diameter.</p><p>You can use an action to unfold the portable hole on a stable solid surface. When unfolded, the item creates a hole 10 feet deep that leads to a cylindrical extra dimensional space which cannot be used to create open passages. Closing the hole requires an action and involves you taking a hold of the edges and folding it up. No matter its contents, the hole weighs next to nothing.</p><p>Food or water placed in a closed portable hole immediately and permanently lose all nourishing qualities&mdash;after being in the item, water no longer slakes thirst and food does not sate hunger or nourish. In a similar fashion, the body of a dead creature placed in the portable hole cannot be restored to life by revivify, raise dead, or other similar magic. Breathing creatures inside a closed portable hole can survive for up to 2d4 minutes divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.</p><p>Creatures inside the hole while it&rsquo;s open can exit the hole by simply climbing out. A creature still within the hole can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check to escape as it is being closed. On a success, the creature appears within 5 feet of the item or creature carrying it.</p><p>Placing a portable hole inside another extradimensional storage device such as a @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-magic-items.Item.yytjmrjkh1qhwrtb]{Bag of Holding} or @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-magic-items.Item.zky1yh7ac8imuvni]{Handy Haversack} results in planar rift that destroys both items and pulls everything within 10 feet into the Astral Plane. The rift then closes and disappears.</p>",
