A creature whispered to in this way makes a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or becomes frightened until the end of its next turn.</p></li></ul><p>Alternatively, as an action while the vision is summoned you can agree to revoke your claim on That Which Spies From Infinity in exchange for its direct assistance. When you do so the parchment melts away into nothing and for the next minute the vision transforms into an eldritch ethereal tentacle within 30 feet.</p><p>On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to verbally instruct the tentacle to make a melee spell attack (+6 bonus to hit) against a target within 10 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 cold damage and its Speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.</p><p>Once you have revoked your claim in this way, you can never invoke That Which Spies From Infinity’s true name again.</p>",
