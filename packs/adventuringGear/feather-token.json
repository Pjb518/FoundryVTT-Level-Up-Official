		"description": "<p>This small silver charm resembles a feather. Many types of feather tokens exist with different effects.</p><p>The Narrator chooses or randomly determines the type of feather token found by rolling d100.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><blockquote><p><strong>TABLE: FEATHER TOKEN</strong></p><p><em>D100 TOKEN (COST)</em></p><ul><li><p><strong><em>1–20</em> Anchor </strong>(550 gp): You can use an action to touch the token to a boat, ship, or other water vehicle. The vessel cannot be moved by any means for the next 24 hours. You can repeat the action to end the effect.</p><p>When the effect ends, the token becomes a mundane item.</p><p></p></li><li><p><strong><em>21–35</em>  Boat</strong> (850 gp): You can use an action to toss the token onto a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token transforms into a 50-foot long, 20-foot wide boat. The boat needs no propulsion and moves at a speed of 6 miles per hour, requiring no skill to operate. You can use an action to direct the boat to turn up to 90 degrees. Up to 32 medium creatures and their equipment can travel comfortably on the boat (Large creatures count as 4 creatures and Huge creatures count as 8 creatures).</p><p>The boat remains for up to 24 hours before disappearing. You may spend an action to dismiss the boat.</p><p></p></li><li><p><strong><em>36–50</em> Bird</strong> (1,000 gp): You can use an action to toss the token nearby where it transforms into a roc. The bird obeys simple commands, though it will not attack, and can fly 16 miles an hour for up to 6 hours while carrying up to 500 pounds, or at half that speed while carrying up to 1,000 pounds.</p><p>The roc disappears after flying its maximum distance or when reduced to 0 hit points. You may spend an action to dismiss the roc.</p><p></p></li><li><p><strong><em>51–65</em> Fan</strong> (550 gp): While on a wind-powered vessel, you can use an action to toss the token into the air where it transforms into a massive flapping fan or palm frond, creating enough wind to power the vessel or increase its speed by 5 miles per hour for up to 8 hours.</p><p>When the effect ends, the token disappears. You may spend an action to dismiss the fan.</p><p></p></li><li><p><strong><em>66–90</em> Tree</strong> (550 gp): While outside, you can use an action to toss the token onto an unoccupied patch of ground where it erupts into a nonmagical living oak tree. The tree is 80 feet tall and has a 5-foot diameter trunk with a branch spread of up to 20 feet.</p><p></p></li><li><p><strong><em>91–100</em> Whip</strong> (700 gp): You can use an action to toss the token to a point that you can see within 10 feet. The token transforms into a floating whip that you can command by using a bonus action, making it move up to 20 feet and attack a creature up to 10 feet away from it. The whip has an attack bonus of +10 and deals 1d6+6 force damage.</p><p>The whip vanishes after 1 hour, when you die, or when you use an action to dismiss it.</p></li></ul></blockquote>",
