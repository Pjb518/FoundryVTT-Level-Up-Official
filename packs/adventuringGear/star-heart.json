		"description": "<p>This item looks like a bright orange starfish.</p><p>Once you are attuned to the star heart it attaches to your skin over your heart, and as long as you have at least 1 hit point you regain 1d6 hit points every 10 minutes.</p><p>If you lose a body part, after 1d6 + 1 days if you have at least 1 hit point the whole time the body part regrows and returns to full functionality. In addition, any lost body part grows into an entirely new version of version of yourself after 1d4 + 3 days, complete with your personality, memory, and abilities.</p><p>This new clone is independent and sentient, although it is incapable of further duplication. Every time a clone is created, one of the five legs of the star heart withers and dies; it only regenerates when its associated clone dies. If all five legs have grown into clones, then the star heart is destroyed.</p><p><strong>Curse</strong>. While some may say that having a clone that believes itself to be just as much “you” as yourself is enough of a curse in and of itself, the star heart has other dangers. It was designed for a disposable warrior class of drones and isn’t quite compatible with other creatures. Every time the star heart creates a clone, there’s a chance that something may go wrong.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p>Roll 1d20 and consult Star Heart Clone Table below. If the result was over 11, then roll again, applying all effects.</p><blockquote><p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>TABLE: STAR HEART CLONE</em></strong></p><p><strong>D20 </strong>EFFECT</p><ul><li><p><strong>1</strong> The clone is an exact copy (unless affected by previous rolls) but it is lifeless.</p></li><li><p><strong>2–11</strong> Nothing. The clone is an exact copy of you (if you have acquired scars or other imperfections over the years that regeneration didn’t cure then the clone will still lack them).</p></li><li><p><strong>12–13</strong> The clone is an exact copy, but its mind has been permanently warped by the regeneration process.</p><p>It rolls once on Table: Long-Term Mental Stress Effects.</p></li><li><p><strong>14–15</strong> The clone is an exact copy but something has changed in its personality. The clone may choose to pursue a different class or profession than you.</p><p>Whenever the clone can see you, it needs to make a DC 12 Wisdom check or it acquires a short-term mental stress effect.</p></li><li><p><strong>16–17</strong> Something is off. The clone may have different colored eyes or hair, new birthmarks or blemishes, or other minor differences (such as a different score in one or two abilities). Such differences are easy to hide and can be difficult to spot.</p><p>These differences prey on the clone’s mind when it is near you. Whenever the clone can see you, it needs to make a DC 12 Wisdom check or it acquires a short-term mental stress effect.</p></li><li><p><strong>18 </strong>The clone is obviously imperfect. At the Narrator’s discretion, the clone may be noticeably shorter, taller, heavier, or lighter than you. The clone has disadvantage on any attempts to disguise itself as you.</p><p>Whenever the clone can see you, it needs to make a DC 14 Wisdom check or it acquires a long-term mental stress effect.</p></li><li><p><strong>19 </strong>The clone is effectively a reincarnation of you. Roll on Table: Reincarnation (page 585 in the Adventurer’s Guide) to determine the clone’s heritage.</p><p>Whenever the clone can see you, it needs to make a DC 14 Wisdom check or it acquires a long-term mental stress effect.</p></li><li><p><strong>20 </strong>There is a darkness within the clone and it wants to replace you. No matter how perfect the copy, the clone always attacks you on sight with the intent to kill (at the Narrator’s discretion, the clone may delay such an act if it would be immediately beneficial to the clone—once the benefit is gone, the bloodlust returns). The clone also plots against you when not in its presence, hiring assassins or otherwise attempting to vex or destroy you.</p><p>(Note that particular mental stress effects do not stack. For example, if the clone has both a personality change and develops a phobia, it only needs to make a single DC 14 Wisdom check when it sees you.)</p></li></ul></blockquote>",
