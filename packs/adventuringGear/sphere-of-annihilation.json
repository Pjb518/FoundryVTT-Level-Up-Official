The default state of the sphere is stationary, but should a creature be in the way of a moving sphere it makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or takes 4d10 force damage.</p><p>While within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere of annihilation, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check and take control of it. On a success, the sphere moves in the direction of your choice a number of feet equal to 5x your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you instead.</p><p>If a sphere is controlled by another creature, you may wrest away control by using an action and making an Intelligence (Arcana) check opposed by the controlling creature. On a success, you take control of the sphere and can utilize it as normal.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p>A unique effect happens when a sphere comes into contact with a planar portal or extradimensional space (such as a portable hole).</p><p>In the case of such an event, the Narrator rolls d100 to determine what happens next:</p><ul><li><p><strong>1–50</strong> the sphere is destroyed</p></li><li><p><strong>51–85</strong> the sphere simply moves through the portal or into the space</p></li><li><p><strong>86–100</strong> a rift forms that pulls in all creatures and objects within 180 feet. Each object and creature, including the sphere, reappears in a random plane of existence.</p></li></ul>",
