		"description": "<p>This item is actually an aperture for the mouth of an immense extradimensional creature and is often mistaken for a bag of holding.</p><p>The creature can perceive everything placed inside the bag. Up to a cubic foot of inanimate objects can be stored inside, however once per day the creature swallows any inanimate objects inside and spews them into another plane of existence (with the Narrator deciding the plane and time of day). Animal or vegetable matter placed completely inside is instead ingested and destroyed.</p><p>This item can be very dangerous. When part of a creature is inside the bag (including a creature reaching a hand inside) there is a 50% chance the bag pulls it inside.</p><p>A creature that ends its turn inside the bag is ingested and destroyed. A creature inside the bag can try to escape by using an action and making a DC 15 Strength check. Creatures outside the bag may use an action to attempt to reach in and pull a creature out with a DC 20 Strength check. This rescue attempt is subject to the same 50% chance to be pulled inside.</p><p>Piercing or tearing the item destroys it, with anything currently inside shifted to a random location on the Astral Plane. Turning the bag inside out closes the mouth.</p>",
