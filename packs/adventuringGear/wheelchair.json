While mounted on a wheelchair you are considered to be wearing the wheelchair as a piece of gear. The wheelchair is mechanically complex, and can ascend stairs and ramps slowly, or provide a boost of speed on the descent. You have a movement speed of 30 feet while mounted on a wheelchair and treat inclines and stairs as difficult terrain, but while moving down slopes, stairs, or other significant declines you may take the Dash action as a bonus action. At the Narrator’s discretion, more advanced and tactical wheelchairs may be available.</p>",
