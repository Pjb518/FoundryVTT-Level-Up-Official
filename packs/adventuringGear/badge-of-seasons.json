So long as at least one of the symbols remains on the badge, fey creatures regard you as a figure of authority. You gain an expertise die on Intimidation and Persuasion checks made to influence fey.</p><p>Whenever you create your pact weapon, you can choose to imbue it with the magic of one of the badge’s four symbols. For the next minute or until your pact weapon disappears, you gain a benefit related to the chosen symbol:</p><p><strong>Spring:</strong> Whenever you use your pact weapon to damage a creature, you regain 1d4 hit points.</p><p><strong>Summer: </strong>Attacks made with your pact weapon deal an additional 1d6 fire damage.</p><p><strong>Autumn:</strong> Whenever you use your pact weapon to damage a creature, the target makes a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or it deals half damage with weapon attacks until the end of your next turn.</p><p><strong>Winter: </strong>You can use a bonus action to teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left each take 1d4 cold damage.</p><p>The symbol disappears after its effect ends. Once you’ve used all four symbols, the badge becomes a mundane item.</p>",
