While wearing this ring, you have advantage on attack rolls against elementals from the linked plane, and they have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. You can also expend 2 of the ring’s charges to cast dominate monster on an elemental native to the linked plane. The ring imparts additional benefits based on the linked plane.</p><p>The ring has 5 charges and regains 1d4+1 charges at dawn. Spells cast from the ring have a save DC of 17. </p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong><em>Ring of Earth Elemental Command</em></strong>. You can speak and understand Terran. While wearing this ring, you are not slowed by difficult terrain composed of rocks, dirt, and other earth. </p><p>If you help kill an earth elemental while attuned to this ring, you gain the following:<br>• Resistance to acid damage.<br>• The ability to move through solid rock and earth as if it were difficult terrain. If you end your turn in those areas, you are pushed into the nearest unoccupied space you last occupied.<br>• The ability to cast the following spells by expending the necessary charges: stone shape (2 charges), stoneskin (3 charges), wall of stone (3 charges).</p>",
