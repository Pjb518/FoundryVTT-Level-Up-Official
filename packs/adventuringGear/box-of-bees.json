		"description": "<p>Many apprentices play pranks on one another, some of which can be quite painfulâ€”the box of bees is a particularly popular example and now sold by those with their own mischievous designs. Each of these wooden boxes is rectangular and approximately 2 inches long. It is usually unadorned, though some boxes seem to have something moving or vibrating inside.</p><p>When you speak the command word and use an action to expend 1 charge, the lid slides open and a bee erupts out of the box to harass a creature of your choice within 20 feet. A creature harassed by the bee must succeed on a DC 5 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute. On a failure, the creature makes its next attack roll or ability check with disadvantage.</p><p>When you speak another command word and expend all 3 charges, a dozen or more bees swarm out of the box and attack. A creature attacked by the bees must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute. On a failure, the creature takes 1 point of damage and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks for 1 round.</p><p>The box has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the box loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.</p>",
