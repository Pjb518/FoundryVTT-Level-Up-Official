		"description": "<p>This large chest has an interior space 5 feet wide, 3&nbsp;feet deep, and 3 feet tall, and appears mundane save&nbsp;that the wood used in its construction is normally&nbsp;reserved for making magic wands. It&rsquo;s magical properties&nbsp;become apparent however when it moves, as it&nbsp;stands on hundreds of tiny humanoid legs and opens&nbsp;to reveal a long red tongue and a rim dotted with&nbsp;sharp teeth. It functions like a typical chest with&nbsp;the following additional properties.</p><p><em><strong>Mimic-Like.</strong></em> The Traveling Chest can use an&nbsp;action to appear to be a mundane chest, and&nbsp;you can verbally command it to do so. While&nbsp;mimicking a normal chest in this way it is indistinguishable&nbsp;from its mundane counterpart.</p><p><em><strong>Multiple Interiors.</strong></em> The Traveling Chest has&nbsp;1,000 different interior spaces, each 5 feet wide, 3&nbsp;feet deep, and 3 feet tall. You can verbally request&nbsp;any particular space (such as the last one, or the&nbsp;one with my laundry in it) and when opened the&nbsp;chest reveals that interior. Otherwise the chest&nbsp;opens to reveal a random interior space. While the&nbsp;chest is closed, all of its interior spaces are located&nbsp;within separate pocket dimensions. These pocket&nbsp;dimensions have no air, and any Supply stored within them instantly deteriorates and rots as if&nbsp;decades have passed as soon as the chest is closed.&nbsp;Only you can summon up the other interiors in&nbsp;this way, and any other creature that opens the&nbsp;chest only finds the &ldquo;first interior&rdquo;.</p><p><em><strong>Relentless.</strong></em> Once you attune to The Traveling&nbsp;Chest, it relentlessly follows you until it sits no&nbsp;more than 15 feet away from you. The chest is&nbsp;magically aware of your location at all times,&nbsp;even if you are on a separate plane. If separated&nbsp;from you the chest travels towards you as fast as&nbsp;it can to the best of its ability and it attacks any&nbsp;creature that attempts to hinder its progress. If&nbsp;you are functionally unreachable, such as being&nbsp;on a different plane or across an ocean, the chest&nbsp;still progresses using even esoteric or hidden&nbsp;methods of reaching you such as magic portals or&nbsp;stowing away on ships headed in your direction.</p><p><em><strong>Imprinted.</strong></em> The Traveling Chest does not relinquish&nbsp;attunement once attuned, and you cannot&nbsp;voluntarily remove this attunement. If you attune&nbsp;to additional magic items beyond your limit, The&nbsp;Traveling Chest always remains as one of your&nbsp;attuned items.</p><p><em><strong>Pack Lightly.</strong></em> The Traveling Chest does not&nbsp;like being weighed down too much, and can&nbsp;carry a maximum of 10 bulky items. Any additional&nbsp;bulky items you attempt to store within&nbsp;it are spit out.</p><p><em><strong>Sentience.</strong></em> The Traveling Chest is a sentient&nbsp;construct with Intelligence 3, Wisdom 14, and&nbsp;Charisma 12. It has blindsight to a range of 60&nbsp;feet. The Traveling Chest cannot speak or read,&nbsp;but it understands Common and Elvish. The&nbsp;Traveling Chest lacks proper communication,&nbsp;but can animalistically communicate simple&nbsp;emotions (most often boredom or rage).</p><p><em><strong>Personality.</strong></em> The Traveling Chest has the&nbsp;intellect and temperament of a poorly trained&nbsp;dog. Loyalty has been branded magically into&nbsp;its psyche but its actual obedience is looser. The&nbsp;chest is playful and quick to anger, yet is utterly&nbsp;committed to following whomever is attuned&nbsp;to it. It also isn&rsquo;t a fighter and ignores outright&nbsp;commands to attack, though it defends itself in&nbsp;combat when it is attacked. It likes to be used for&nbsp;its intended purpose, happiest when numerous&nbsp;items are stored within it and regularly retrieved.&nbsp;If left idle or unused for more than a day it will come into conflict. While in conflict the chest&nbsp;intentionally opens to the wrong interior spaces,&nbsp;or remains indignantly locked, and it generally&nbsp;acts snippy and uncooperative. An apology and&nbsp;DC 14 Animal Handling or Persuasion check&nbsp;calms the chest down and ends the conflict, or if&nbsp;it feels genuinely mistreated, it can be offered a&nbsp;full wardrobe&rsquo;s worth of new clothing to store&nbsp;as a peace offering.</p>",
