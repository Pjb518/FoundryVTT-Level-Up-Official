		"description": "<p><em>Dual-Wielding, Simple, Requires Attunement by a Druid or Ranger</em></p>\n<p>This seems like nothing more than a simple tool at first, rough at the handle and rusted at the edges,&nbsp;but the sickle&rsquo;s impossibly sharp and shining crescent&nbsp;blade reveals its true nature.</p>\n<p>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic sickle. It has the following additional properties.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Red Reaping.</strong></em> Whenever you use Harvest to&nbsp;reduce a living creature to 0 hit points, it absorbs&nbsp;that creature&rsquo;s soul and stores it within. Harvest&nbsp;cannot store more than one soul in this way and&nbsp;the souls of any creatures you reduce to 0 hit&nbsp;points while a creature&rsquo;s soul is already contained&nbsp;within it are not affected by this property.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Sow the Reaped.</strong></em> You can use an action to strike&nbsp;the ground with the sickle and produce a blood&nbsp;clone using a creature&rsquo;s soul stored within Harvest.&nbsp;This blood clone appears in an unoccupied space&nbsp;adjacent to you and uses the statistics the creature&nbsp;had when it was alive, except it is both ooze and&nbsp;undead in addition to its other types. Blood clones&nbsp;formed in this way act immediately after you in&nbsp;initiative, and they obey your verbal commands to&nbsp;the best of their ability. Without such commands,&nbsp;the blood clone only defends itself. Once formed,&nbsp;a blood clone remains until destroyed or until 10&nbsp;minutes pass, after which it dissolves into rotten&nbsp;offal and the trapped soul travels to whatever&nbsp;afterlife was intended for it.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Only Life May Die.</strong></em> Harvest has no effect&nbsp;on unliving creatures, and passes harmlessly&nbsp;through constructs and undead when it is used&nbsp;to attack them.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Sentience.</strong></em> Harvest is a sentient weapon with&nbsp;Intelligence 14, Wisdom 18, and Charisma 17. It&nbsp;sees and hears using your senses. Harvest communicates&nbsp;with only you telepathically and can read,&nbsp;speak, and understand Common, Halfling, and&nbsp;Orc. It cannot communicate with a creature it is&nbsp;not attuned to.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Personality.</strong></em> This sickle originally had a much&nbsp;more benign purpose, created by a halfling&nbsp;archdruid to bring forth a new plant for each&nbsp;one harvested. When its creator was killed by an orcish warchief it became a weapon, and&nbsp;in her hands it grew to find a new purpose. It&nbsp;eventually convinced its bearer to sow what&nbsp;she reaped, and caused the very spirit and&nbsp;blood of those she had cut down to slaughter&nbsp;its orcish captors. Harvest has come to believe&nbsp;that all people are inherently wicked and deserve&nbsp;death. It believes that real peace can only be&nbsp;achieved when the last mind capable of war&nbsp;and cruelty goes silent, leaving nothing but&nbsp;the plants and beasts. Harvest tolerates people&nbsp;with a connection to nature but only if they&nbsp;are regularly giving it a chance to continue its&nbsp;&ldquo;culling&rdquo;. It whispers often of its great work, and&nbsp;begs you to enrich the earth&rsquo;s soil with blood&nbsp;that it spills. If you go more than 3 days without&nbsp;using Harvest to slay a sentient creature, you&rsquo;ll&nbsp;be in conflict with Harvest. When in conflict,&nbsp;any time you use the Sow the Reaped property&nbsp;the resulting blood clone ignores your verbal&nbsp;orders and attacks you to the best of its ability.&nbsp;If you are killed by the blood clone in this way,&nbsp;your soul is absorbed into Harvest.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Destroying Harvest.</strong></em> Harvest is unbreakable but&nbsp;a person that has mastered nature can unmake&nbsp;it. With 24 hours worth of ritual work, any 20th&nbsp;level druid can deconstruct the weapon and return&nbsp;its tortured mind to the earth it was formed from,&nbsp;rendering Harvest an inert mundane sickle made&nbsp;with a moonstone blade.</p>",
