Unplanting a tower shield requires a bonus action.</p><p>Tower shields are bulky items, and count as such even when donned.</p><p><strong><em>Curse</em></strong>. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, you become the target instead. Removing the shield does not stop the curse.</p>",
