It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h5>Domain Spells</h5>\n<p>Each domain has a list of spells—its domain spells—that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\n<p>If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p>",
