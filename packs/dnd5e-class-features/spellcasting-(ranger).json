		"description": "<p>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does.</p><h5>Spell Slots</h5><p>The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <em>animal friendship </em>and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <em>animal friendship </em>using either slot.</p><h5>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5><p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5><p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC </strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier </strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>",
