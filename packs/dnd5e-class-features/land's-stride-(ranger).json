You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p><p>In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.gMrWeG8fMDPRFiVe]{Entangle} spell.</p>",
