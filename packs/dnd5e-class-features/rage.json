On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action. While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:</p><ul><li><p>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</p></li><li><p>When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.</p></li><li><p>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</p></li></ul><p>If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging. </p><p>Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. </p><p>Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</p>",
